<p class="pn p2">In the motorist's life there are hours that
can never be forgotten. It may be some
hour of sunshine that haunts us, when the
warm wind, we remember, was heavy with
the scent of gorse or pungent with the stinging
breath of the sea; or some hour when
the road lay white and straight before us
across a moor, and the waves of heather
rolled away from us to the horizon in long
curves of colour, and as we sped over the
miles we seemed no nearer to the shore of
the purple sea nor to the end of the white
straight road; or it may be, perhaps, the
hour of our gradual approach to some ancient
city transfigured in the sunset, "soft as old
sorrow, bright as old renown." But, whatever
the scene may be, whether moor or fen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
forest or shore, there are two elements which
are always present in the motorist's memory
of a happy run&mdash;a good surface, and a good
engine.</p>

<p>No one could travel in Yorkshire, I think,
without adding to his store of unforgotten
hours. So great is the variety of scenery
and interest that all must somewhere find
the landscape that appeals to them. Some
will remember those moors of Cleveland that
have no visible limit, and some the many-coloured
dales of the West Riding, and some
the straight roads of the plain where the
engine hums so gaily. Some will ever after
dream of the day when they followed the
course of the wooded Tees; others will dream
of the distant towers of York or Beverley,
or of the heights and depths of the Buttertubs
Pass. And, to be quite frank, there are
some to whom this last exciting dream will
be rather of the nature of a nightmare.</p>

<p>In more ways than one Yorkshire is a good
field for motoring. Throughout the greater
part of the county there are few hedges, and
the stone walls that take the place of these
are low. The roads are wide and their surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
good, except in unfrequented places. Now in
Yorkshire the places that are unfrequented
are very few indeed, and it is in connection
with this fact that the motorist has the
greatest advantage over every other kind of
tourist. He can choose his own time for
visiting Bolton or Fountains or the incomparable
Rievaulx; he can see them when the
dew is on the grass and the glamour of solitude
is in the woods. To be alone with our
emotions is what we all desire in the presence
of wide spaces or stately aisles; and in this
county, where there is so much beauty to be
seen and so many to see it, those only who
possess "speed as a chattel" can ever hope
to be alone. It is almost impossible to lay
too much stress on our advantages, as motorists,
in this matter of securing peace.</p>

<p>Looking back upon a tour among the Yorkshire
dales, I see that the keynote was struck
at the very outset by the little town of Skipton,
with its grey granite houses and slated
roofs, its wide street and the castle above
it, the ancient church and the tombs of the
great. Such are a hundred Yorkshire villages
and little towns. Each of them, it seems, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
connected with some historic name. In the
case of Skipton the name is Clifford. If the
first builders of the castle and the church
were not Cliffords, but de Romilles, it was the
Cliffords who made both castle and church
what they now are. It was a Clifford who
built the long gallery and the octagon tower
that we see beyond the grass of the great
outer court; it was a Clifford who repaired
all the other towers; a Clifford who devised
the curious shell-pictures that line the guardroom;
Cliffords who lived for centuries in the
castle, and the few Cliffords that died in their
beds who enriched the church with their
tombs. Their motto, "<i>Désormais</i>," stands up
against the sky in letters of stone above the
round towers of their gateway, and their
arms are carved above the inner door.
The court on which this door opens, the
"Conduit Court," as it is called, is the very core
of Skipton, and one of the most romantic
places I have ever seen. It would seize the
dullest imagination&mdash;this little paved enclosure
shut in on every side, the long flight
of steps, the doorways with the crumbling
carvings, the mullioned windows, the yew-tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
that has seen so many centuries, the low
stone seat with its shields, the Norman archway
through which all the Cliffords have
passed. Most of the feet that came this way
awoke ringing echoes under the old arch,
for the Cliffords were wont to be dressed
in coats of mail. They were all mighty in
war. The first armour-clad baron of the
name, he who began the building of this
court and died at Bannockburn, has clattered
through this doorway; and after him the
hero of Créçy; and later on that other who
fought for Henry V. and died at Meaux; and
he who fell at St. Albans in the cause of
Lancaster; and his son and avenger, called
"the Butcher," who slew that "fair gentleman
and maiden-like person," the young Earl
of Rutland, and was himself slain at Towton;
and the great sailor, Cumberland, who made
nine voyages and fought the Spaniards for
Queen Elizabeth. Here, too, when he came
to his own at last, has stood that strange,
romantic figure, the Shepherd Lord, who
spent his youth in hiding among the northern
hills, yet who, despite his love of solitude and
learning, could not forget his long ancestry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of fighting men, and himself fought on
Flodden Field.</p>

<p class="b1">Among all these heroes the kings who have
come through this doorway cut rather a sorry
figure: Edward II., a sorry figure in any
company; Richard III., a usurper here as in
larger courts, playing the master while the
true lord of Skipton was keeping sheep; and
Henry VIII., who came here to take part in
a wedding&mdash;a spectator for once. The bride
on this occasion was his niece, Eleanor
Brandon, the daughter of that love-match
that was so great a failure, between the
Duke of Suffolk and Mary, Princess of
England and Queen Dowager of France.
The wedding ceremony took place in the
long gallery, which was built for the occasion
by the bridegroom's father. Lady Eleanor's
granddaughter, Lady Pembroke, was more
closely connected with this spot where we
are standing than any Clifford who came
before her.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Anne Clifford, Countess of Pembroke, who
rustled through this archway many a time,
no doubt, while the castle of her ancestors
was being repaired at her charges, was a
very busy woman. "Her house was a home
for the young, and a retreat for the aged;
an asylum for the persecuted, a college
for the learned, and a pattern for all." She
restored six castles, we are told, and built
seven churches and two hospitals; she erected
a monument to Spenser; she wrote some
memoirs, too, with a record of all these
things, and wherever she made her mark
she stamped her initials. You can see them,
very large and clear, if you look overhead
upon the leaden spouting of this court, and
you may see them again in the windows of the
church. Anne Clifford's disposition was in no
respect a retiring one, as we may gather from
her famous answer to the Secretary of State
who wished a nominee of his own to stand
for her borough of Appleby. "I have been
bullied by a usurper," she said, "and neglected
by a Court, but I will not be dictated to by
a subject. Your man shall not stand."</p>

<p>Her work in restoring her castle of Skipton
was no light undertaking, for it had lately
endured a three years' siege by the army of
the Parliament, and its seven towers must
have been sadly battered before the day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
its proud surrender. So defiant was that
surrender that the garrison marched out
through the great entrance gate beneath
the motto of the Cliffords, "accordingley to
the Honour of a Souldier, with colours flying,
Trumpets sounding, Drums beating, Matches
lighted at both ends, and Bullets in their
Mouthes," while the commissioned officers took
with them "their wearing apparell that was
properley their owne in their Portmantles."</p>

<p>One other pious work did Anne perform.
She made a magnificent tomb for her father
the Admiral, third Earl of Cumberland&mdash;who
fought the Armada with the Queen's glove
in his hat&mdash;and she set upon it seventeen
armorial shields, all gilt and painted, and
a mighty black marble slab, and a list of
honours. We may see it in the chancel of
the church she repaired; this grey church
that stands so picturesquely at the end of
the long street, with the hollyhocks and
daisies brightening its dark walls. Opposite
to the grave of Lady Pembroke's father is
that of her little brother, "an infant of most
rare towardness in all the appearances that
might promise wisdome"; and near to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
is the splendid tomb, with restored brasses,
of the first Earl of Cumberland. Such of
the earlier Cliffords as found burial at all,
including the Shepherd Lord, were laid in
Bolton Abbey, whose monks were connected
with this church and gave it the delicately
carved screen that adds so much to its
beauty.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said or hinted that Jane
Clifford, the Rose of the World, was in some
way connected with Skipton. This can hardly
be the case, however, for the Fair Rosamund
was born and spent her childhood on the
banks of the Wye, and was laid in her
temporary grave at Godstowe long before
Edward II. gave this castle to the Cliffords
who came after her.</p>

<p>From Skipton, where homely comfort may
be found at the sign of the "Black Horse," an
expedition should be made to Malham and its
famous Cove, about twelve miles away; and
if time allows, the run may be lengthened
very enjoyably by rejoining the main road
at Hellifield and skirting the moors as far
as Clapham or Ingleton. In this way we
shall see something of the craggy country of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Craven, of which Camden wrote long ago:
"What with huge stones, steep rocks, and
rough ways, this place is very wild and
unsightly." The huge stones and steep rocks
are still there, but the way by which we go
is very far from being rough; it is, on the
contrary, such an exceptionally fine road that
it seems almost a pity to leave it. Those
who wish to see Malham, however, must turn
off at Gargrave or Coniston.</p>

<p>Much has been written concerning Malham
Cove, and many long adjectives used. Some
writers have even declared themselves terrified
by it; but these, I think, must have been
of a timid temperament. It is the position
of the place, no doubt, that has this overwhelming
effect upon some minds: the sudden
and unexpected presence of a great semi-circular
cliff amid quiet undulating fields. If one
could be carried blindfold to the foot of it
I can imagine that it would be truly imposing;
but it is visible from a distance as a grey
scar on the face of the green hillside, and
thus a good deal of its effect is lost in the
course of a gradual approach. The best way
to reach it is to walk across the fields from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Malham village, following the course of the
Aire, the stream that tunnels its way so
strangely into the Cove. There is, it is true,
a narrow and steep road which commands
a fine view of it as a whole, but there is
no room here for any but a small car to
turn, and there is no doubt that the cliff
can best be seen on foot.</p>

<p class="b1">This is true also of its more imposing
neighbour, Gordale Scar. Says Wordsworth&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppn40">"Let thy feet repair</p>
<p class="ppn20">To Gordale chasm, terrific as the lair<br />
Where young lions couch,"</p>

<p class="p1">and indeed, as the hill that approaches Gordale
Chasm is nearly as terrific as the chasm
itself, it is certainly best, if not imperative,
to repair to it on thy feet. I believe that the
tarn which lies upon the moor above Malham
Cove, and long ago belonged to the monks
of Fountains, may be reached by road, but
I have not been there myself.</p>

<p>From Malham the way is narrow and surprisingly
tortuous as far as Hellifield, but
here we rejoin the splendid high road we
left at Coniston, and speed along it through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Ribblesdale to Settle. This small town has
progressive ambitions. It "treats" the surface
of its main road, it lights its streets
by electricity, it has a fine new garage and
a hotel that has the air of being nice. It
is attractive, too, and pretty as well as praiseworthy,
with hills behind it and a tiny weir
above the bridge. Beyond it we pass the
ebbing and flowing spring of Giggleswick in
its stone basin by the wayside; climb the
long hill under the grey crags of Giggleswick
Scar, with a splendid backward view, and
run down by wood and beck to Clapham,
where the village cross stands close to the
stream in the shadow of the trees. Not very
far away is the famous cave, bristling with
stalactites. After leaving Clapham we cross
a wide heath, with the throttle open.</p>

<p>First and last this is a good run. On the
left is the open country; on the right that
wild land of huge stones and steep rocks that
seemed to Camden so unsightly, in an age
when the whole duty of a landscape was to
smile. Clambering on the hillside in a cleft
of the crags are the narrow, winding streets
of Ingleton, and a viaduct spanning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
valley. This valley, which is hardly wider
than a gorge, is said to be well worth
exploring; but neither its waterfall, Thornton
Force, nor its caves of Yordas and Weathercote,
can be seen by road. They hardly
concern us here. It concerns us rather to
return to Skipton, and thence to strike up
into the heart of the hills.</p>

<p class="b1">Climbing the road above the castle we see
how Skipton lies in a hollow among the
moors. Behind us to the south is the Brontë
country; Haworth and its graves far off
beyond Airedale, and Stonegappe only three
miles away. It was at Stonegappe that
Charlotte reluctantly taught the little Sidgwicks,
and no doubt made them suffer nearly
as much as she suffered herself from her
over-sensitive feelings. Embsay Moor appears
on our right as we rise, and beyond it the
savage outline of Rylstone Fell, with the
ruined watch-tower of the Nortons, the foes
of the Cliffords, showing desolately against
the sky upon the topmost crag. Of the
Nortons and their tower, and the daughter
of their house, and of the White Doe of
Rylstone and her weekly journey across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
moors to the grave of the youth with whom
the Nortons ended, Wordsworth has told us.
We are running down now into "the valley
small," where the house of the Nortons once
stood, and here is the Church where</p>

<p class="ppn30">"the bells of Rylstone played</p>
<p class="ppn20">Their Sabbath music&mdash;<i>God us ayde</i>!"</p>

<p class="p1">At Threshfield we turn to the left and are
in Wharfedale.</p>

<p>The names of all these Yorkshire Dales
are very familiar in our ears. Wharfedale,
Wensleydale, Swaledale, Teesdale&mdash;they are
all words with a charm in them. And here,
as we glide out of a wood, is Wharfedale
spread before us; and we know at last that
it is not only in the name that the charm
lies.</p>

<p>The river flows below through the wide
valley and winds away in shining curves into
the far distance, past the bluff outline of
Kilnsey Crag, past the dark belt of firs, till
it vanishes among the folds of the jewelled
hills. For in their liquid brilliancy the
colouring of all these dales is that of gems,
of amethyst and emerald, of sapphire and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
turquoise and opal; and the sunlight that
floods them on the days when we are
fortunate has the luminous gold of the
topaz. As we drive under the overhanging
crag of Kilnsey&mdash;"the highest and steepest
that ever I saw," says Camden&mdash;and pass the
tiny village where the sheep belonging to the
Abbey of Fountains used to be shorn, the
hills begin to close in, till, as we draw near
Kettlewell, they rise round us so protectively
that we seem to have entered a new and
calmer world. Kettlewell itself is so calm as
to appear asleep. Its grey houses, shadowed
by trees and sheltered by the mighty shoulder
of Great Whernside, are defended from every
wind, and from every sound but the rippling
of the Wharfe. Beyond this peaceful spot,
where we cross the river, the road is rather
rough, and after passing through pretty
Buckden it is also extremely narrow. However,
it leads to Hubberholme, and no more
than that need be asked of any road.</p>

<p>At Hubberholme the river is still wide, and
thickly strewn with stones; the slopes of the
hills are very near and steep, and are clothed
with bracken and fir-trees, and deeply cleft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
by tiny becks; masses of wild flowers fringe
the banks with clouds of mystic blue; and
beyond an old stone bridge stands the church,
low and grey, with a paved pathway and a
porch bright with crimson ramblers. The
rough walls have stood in this lonely spot
for many centuries. The door is open, and
we may see for ourselves the strange state
of the masonry within, whose builders, when
they left it thus rugged and unplastered,
little thought that its unfinished appearance
would be tenderly cherished by the antiquarians
of a future age. A rare rood-loft
of oak divides the tiny chancel from the
nave. This loft dates from the year 1558,
the last year that the Old Faith reigned in
England; and in this remote hiding-place
among the hills it escaped the vigilant eye
of Elizabeth and the destructive hands of
the Puritans.</p>

<p>On returning to Kettlewell we shall find
it worth our while to continue the journey
down the dale on the road that passes
through Conistone, for though it is not so
good, as regards surface, as that on the right
bank of the river, it commands a different&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a very lovely&mdash;series of views. From
Grassington we cross to Linton, on the right
bank, where there are some little falls whose
prettiness is hardly striking enough to
allure us from our way; and at Burnsall
we should keep to the same side of the
stream rather than follow the public conveyances
to the left bank. Horse-drawn
travellers may well be excused for shirking
the hill above Burnsall; but few gradients
have any terrors for us, and the backward
view of Wharfedale from the high hillside
is more beautiful than anything we have yet
seen in Yorkshire. The two roads meet near
Barden Tower, the beloved retreat of the
Shepherd Lord.</p>

<p class="b1">Henry, the tenth Lord Clifford, was a very
small boy when his father, "the Butcher," lost
his estates, his cause, and his life, on the blood-red
grass of Towton. It was not without
reason that John Clifford was surnamed "the
Butcher." It was in vain that young Rutland
knelt to him for mercy on Wakefield Bridge,
"holding up both his hands and making
dolorous countenance, for his speech was
gone for fear." "By God's blood," snarled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Clifford, "thy father slew mine, and so will
I do thee and all thy kin!" And he plunged
his dagger into the boy's heart. "In this
act," says the historian, "the Lord Clifford
was accounted a tyrant and no gentleman.
With his hands still dyed with the son's blood
he savagely cut off the head of the dead
father, the busy, plotting head of Richard,
Duke of York, and carried it, crowned with
paper, 'in great despite and much derision,'"
to the Lancastrian Queen. "Madam, your
war is done," he cried, "here is your King's
ransom!" Margaret of Anjou, for all her
manly ways, became rather hysterical at the
hideous sight, laughing violently with pale
lips; and Clifford's triumph was short.
While he lay with an arrow through his
throat upon the field of Towton&mdash;which we
shall see later on&mdash;his little son was hurried
away to a shepherd's hut in the north, where
in the course of twenty-five years or so on
the hillside he learnt more than the tending
of sheep. He became the gentlest of his
line, a lover of learning, a watcher of the
skies; and though at last Skipton came back
to him, and Brougham, and Pendragon, and
many another castle, he lived here quietly
in this simple tower above the wooded
Wharfe, befriending the poor, reading his
books, and now and then reading the stars
as well, with his friends the monks of Bolton.</p>

<p class="p1 ppq20">"And ages after he was laid in earth,<br />
The good Lord Clifford was the name he bore."</p>

<p class="p1">His descendant, the notable Lady Pembroke,
whose initials are so conspicuous at
Skipton, expended some of her energy here
at Barden. This was one of the six castles
she restored, and over the door we may read
the inscription she placed there according to
her habit, with all her names and titles
recorded at length, and a reference to a
complimentary text about "the repairer of
the breach."</p>

<p>Those who wish to see the famous Strid&mdash;and
none should miss the sight&mdash;may leave
their cars by the wayside at a point not very
far from Barden Tower; but this is not the
course I recommend. The Bolton woods are
beautiful beyond description, and it is only
by walking or driving through them from
the Abbey to the Strid, or even to Barden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Tower, that one can fully enjoy their ferny
slopes and serried stems, and the little shining
streams that slip through them to the
Wharfe. George Eliot and George Lewes
once spent a whole day wandering together
along these paths, and we might follow in
their footsteps very happily, I think. Those
who prefer to drive must hire carriages, for
motors are not admitted to the woods; but
the existence of a very nice little hotel at
Bolton Bridge makes everything easy.</p>

<p class="b1">By one means or another the Strid must
be seen. Here the Wharfe is contracted into
a narrow cleft, an abrupt chasm between
low masses of rock; and the angry river,
suddenly straitened in its course, has in its
convulsions bitten into the stone till it is
riddled with a thousand holes and hollows.
When the river is low it is possible to leap
across from rock to rock. This is the leap
that Alice de Meschines' boy attempted but
failed to achieve so many years ago, when
the hounds he held in leash hesitated to
follow him, and so dragged him back into
the torrent. "I will make many a poor
man's son my heir," said his mother; and
the priory that her parents had founded at
Embsay was moved by her to Bolton, and
greatly enriched in memory of the drowned
Boy of Egremond. Here is the stone from
which he leapt, they say, and here the stone
he never reached, and both are polished by
the feet of those who have been more
successful. This legend&mdash;and I fear the
unkinder "myth" would be the more accurate
word&mdash;has prompted several poets to make
verses, but has signally failed to inspire them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1 b1">All that is left of Bolton Priory is before
us when we reach the Cavendish Memorial.
Close to this spot, though hidden from the
road, is the log hut known as Hartington
Seat, the point of view whence the ruin
looks its loveliest. We are at the edge of
a wooded cliff. The Priory lies far below
us in its level graveyard, framed in trees;
the river sweeps away from our feet, and
after curving thrice, disappears into the
blue haze of the hills. Between the churchyard
and the foot of the red cliffs beyond
the Wharfe lies the regular line of the
monks' stepping-stones, by which for many
centuries, probably, the congregation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
faithful came from the hills to their devotions;
and came, too, on other occasions,
laden with fruit or game for the hospitable
table of the prior. Do not go to Bolton on
a bank holiday, nor, if you can help it, in
August, lest you should find as many people
as were there in the days of its splendour,
when the canons and the lay-brethren and
the men-at-arms and the thirty servants
and the unnumbered serfs and the frequent
guests made it a stirring place. Yet it is
always possible to find an early hour when
there is peace in the ruined choir, where
somewhere in the shadow of the arcaded
walls the dust of the Shepherd Lord lies
under the grass. Bolton was sold to the
Shepherd's son, the first Earl of Cumberland,
at the time of the Dissolution, when
the building of the west tower was brought
to a sudden standstill, and the nave, the
parish church, was separated by a wall
from the choir, the monks' church, which
would be needed no more. There stands
the tower, still unfinished; and here is the
nave, now, as then, a parish church, where
for seven hundred years without interruption,
it is said, services have been held
Sunday by Sunday. The beauty of the
interior, unfortunately, is not great. The
Early Victorian Age has left its fatal stamp
upon it. It was not till forty years ago
that the walls were cleansed of whitewash;
and in 1851 a large sum of money was
mis-spent at the Great Exhibition in acquiring
some dreadful glass.</p>

<p class="p1">The motorist's route from Bolton Bridge
to Harrogate is undoubtedly the moorland
road by Blubberhouses. The contour-book
describes it as rough and steep; but the
steepness is nowhere very severe, and the
surface is now excellent, while the moors
have their usual charms&mdash;charms not only
for the artist, though these are appealing
enough, but special charms for the motorist
too, the delight of an unfenced road and
a wide country. Not that this road lies
altogether on the moors. There are woods
here and there, and soft, green beds of
bracken, and slopes of massive rock; and
presently we pass the great reservoir of the
Leeds waterworks. Then the country opens
out again, and we have a series of fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
wide views till Harrogate appears below
us, occupying a considerable proportion of
the landscape.</p>

<p>Harrogate is exactly what one would expect
it to be: a place of large hotels and fine
shops, a place whose ideals are comfort and
prosperity. Those who like to motor round
a centre&mdash;a plan which has many advantages&mdash;could
hardly find a better base for
their operations.</p>

<p>"The great merit of Harrogate," wrote
George Eliot, "is that one is everywhere
close to lovely open walks." Our field has
widened since her day, but Harrogate's
great merit is still its merit as a centre.
In this respect it is superior even to York,
though in itself not worthy to be named
with that incomparable city. To the west,
within easy distance, are Nidderdale and
Wharfedale; to the north are Ripon, Fountains,
and Jervaulx, with Middleham and
even Wensleydale for the enterprising; to
the south is Kirkstall Abbey on the outskirts
of Leeds. Byland and Rievaulx may
be seen in a single day's drive, and only
twenty-one miles away is York itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Harrogate is so entirely, so aggressively
modern, so resolute to let bygones be bygones,
that one learns with something of a
shock how it came by its name. Harrogate,
it appears, means the Soldiers' Hill on
the Road. The soldiers who lived on the
hill were Roman: the road was the Roman
road through the forest of Knaresborough.
Except for this faint hint of an earlier and
more strenuous life, the history of Harrogate
is the history of its "Spaw." These
crowded acres were a bare, uninhabited
common at the end of the sixteenth century,
when Captain Slingsby, wandering one
day across the Stray, was led by the tewits
to a spring that cured him of his ills,
which had hitherto yielded only to the
waters of Germany. He set a roof over
the precious spot, and so this spring became
the <i>fons et origo</i> of modern Harrogate.
And the Stray, though now in the heart
of a large town, is still uninhabited, still
common-land; for a century after the discovery
of the Tewit Well, when hotels were
already thick upon the surrounding ground,
an Act of Parliament was passed by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
two hundred acres of land were presented
for ever to the people of Harrogate, to
serve for the daily walks of those who
drank the waters.</p>

<p>At Knaresborough, only three miles further
on, we are in a very different world, the
world of old houses and older tales, of
monarchs and saints, of William the Conqueror
and the proud de Stutteville, of
Richard, king in name but not in deed, and
of Oliver, king in deed but not in name&mdash;an
inspiring world, one would think. The
first view of the town, too&mdash;the river, and
the high, unusual bridge, and the red
houses on the hillside, and above them the
castle that had once so proud a crown of
towers&mdash;seems to promise much. Looking
at that fragment of a fortress we remember
those who have owned it; the de
Burgh who built it; the de Stutteville who
fought in the Battle of the Standard; Piers
Gaveston, who is better forgotten; de
Morville, murderer of Beckett, hiding here
from justice; Queen Philippa, whom we are
glad to remember for any reason; John
of Gaunt; Charles I. And we remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Richard II., a prisoner in the one tower
that still stands, alone with his humiliating
memories.</p>

<p>This one glimpse of the castle and its
past, however, is all that Knaresborough
can give us of romance. It is almost best
to ask no more, for a nearer view of the
crumbling keep will leave us very sad.
The path that leads to it, the path that
took de Morville to safety and Richard to
prison, is neatly asphalted, and lighted with
gas-lamps on stone bases, which the local
guide-book describes as "ornamental." Hard
by the door through which the sad king
passed from his shame at Westminster, and
went forth again to the mystery of Pontefract,
stands a penny-in-the-slot machine.
A custodian will show us the guardroom
and its relics, and even the dungeon; but
we must be careful to look at them in the
right order, or we shall be rebuked. The
wolf-trap must be seen before the Conqueror's
chest, and Philippa's chest before
the armour from Marston Moor. By this
time the glamour has faded. Even the fine
view from the castle rock must be inspected&mdash;<i>inspected</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
is the right word&mdash;from
nicely painted seats, placed at regular intervals
in the shelter of clipped evergreens.</p>

<p>The most satisfactory place in Knaresborough
is the Old Manor beside the river,
where the original "roof-tree" round which
the house was built still grows up through
the rooms, and would be taller if a too
zealous workman had not aspired to "make
it tidy." A great deal of beautiful furniture
has been gathered in the panelled rooms,
including the sturdy and simple oak bedstead
in which Oliver Cromwell slept when
he was staying in the house that faces the
Crown Hotel, in the upper part of the
town. Perhaps the bed was brought here
when Oliver's lodging was pulled down and
rebuilt, as happened some time ago. The
floor of his room was carefully preserved;
that floor on which the landlady's little
girl, peeping through the keyhole at "this
extraordinary person," saw him kneeling at
his prayers. It was in this town that he
gathered his troops to meet the Scottish
invasion, and from hence that he marched
out, by way of Otley, Skipton, and Clitheroe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to defeat the Duke of Hamilton at Preston.
The siege of the castle was not his work:
Fairfax had taken it by assault some years
earlier. Cromwell had sad memories in
connection with Knaresborough, for it was
somewhere in its neighbourhood that his
second boy, Oliver, was killed. "I thought
he looked sad and wearied," said a contemporary
who met him just before the battle
of Marston Moor, "for he had had a sad
loss&mdash;young Oliver had got killed to death
not long before, I heard; it was near
Knaresborough."</p>

<p>To see the Dropping Well we must cross
the river by bridge or ferry, and walk
along a pretty path under the beeches.
Here, as everywhere in Knaresborough,
disillusion dogs our steps. This beautiful
curiosity of nature, this great overhanging
rock, worn smooth by the perpetual dripping
of the water, framed in moss and
ferns, has been made into a "side-show,"
with a railing, an entrance fee, and a row
of bowler hats, stuffed parrots, and other
ornaments in process of petrifaction. On
the other side of the river is St. Robert's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Chapel. Here, too, the world is too much
with us.</p>

<p>Leland, that stout traveller, who "was
totally enflammid with a love to see
thoroughly al those partes of this opulente
and ample reaulme ... and notid yn so
doing a hole worlde of thinges very memorable,"
tells us how Robert Flower, the son
of a man "that had beene 2 tymes mair of
York," came to these rocks by the river
Nidd "desiring a solitarie life as an hermite."
He made himself this chapel, "hewen
owte of the mayne stone"; and he seems to
have had some persuasive power of goodness
or wisdom that turned his enemies
into friends. "King John was ons of an
il-wille to this Robert Flour," yet ended by
benefiting him and his, an unusual developement
in the case of King John; and
de Stutteville, who lived up at the castle,
had actually set out to raid the hermitage,
suspecting it to harbour thieves, when he
too, persuaded by a vision or otherwise,
suddenly became the hermit's friend. This
tiny sanctuary, eight or nine feet long, with
its altar and groined roof and recesses for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
relics, all wrought in the solid rock, would
be a place to stimulate the imagination if
it were not that the surroundings and the
guide are such as would cause the strongest
imagination to wilt.</p>

<p>Some say that the black slab of marble
which is now a memorial to Sir Henry
Slingsby in the parish church once formed
the altar-top in St. Robert's Chapel; others
say it came from the Priory, and was raised
there in honour of the saint who "forsook his
fair lands" and caused the Priory's foundation.
The slab lies in the Slingsby chapel,
and records that Sir Henry was executed
"by order of the tyrant Cromwell." Carlyle
tells us that this Slingsby, "a very constant
Royalist all along," was condemned for plotting
the betrayal of Hull to the Royalists.</p>

<p>The road from Knaresborough to Ripon
follows the valley of the Nidd as far as
Ripley. This village has the air of being a
feudal survival. Its cottages with their neatness
and their flowers, its <i>Hôtel de Ville</i>, and
even the "treated" surface of its excellent
road, all bear the stamp of a close connection
with the castle whose park gates are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
at the corner. In the sixteenth century the
village of Ripley was under the eye of a
very masterful lady. It was to this castle
that Oliver Cromwell, tired from fighting
on Marston Moor, came in search of rest.
Rest, however, was denied him. His hostess,
whose husband was away, had no sympathy
with fatigue that came from resisting the
King's Majesty, and so poor Oliver&mdash;"sad
and wearied," as we know, even before the
battle&mdash;spent the night on a chair in the
hall, while Lady Ingilby, seated opposite
to him with a couple of pistols in her
hands, kept her relentless eye upon him
till the morning. When he rode away she
told him it was fortunate for him that he
had been so tractable. I think this fierce
lady must have been agreeable to Oliver's
grim humour.</p>

<p>The approach to Ripon is pretty, by a
road shaded with trees. Above the town
rises the cathedral, massive and stately if
not superlatively beautiful. Though it is
not one of our largest cathedrals, its history
is immense.</p>

<p>Even St. Wilfrid's seventh-century church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
was not the first that stood here, for before
his remote day Eata had founded a monastery
that was hardly built before the Danes
burnt it. Indeed, the monastery was destroyed
so often&mdash;by Danes, Anglo-Saxons,
Normans, and Scots in turn&mdash;that every
style of architecture, from Saxon to Perpendicular,
is represented in the various
restorations. There are even, I believe, in
the crypt and chapter-house, fragments of
Wilfrid's own church, among them being
the curious slit called Wilfrid's Needle,
which has been "mighty famous," as
Camden said, for a great many centuries.
The saint himself was mighty famous in
his day, as he well deserved to be. Even
still we know a good deal about him,
through Bede and others: how, when he
was a poor and ignorant boy of fourteen,
"not enduring the frowardness of his stepmother,
he went to seek his fortune," and
was brought to the notice of Queen Eanfled,
"whom for his wit and beauty he was
not unfit to serve"; and how she sent him
to Lindisfarne, where, "being of an acute
understanding, he in a very short time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
learnt the psalms and some books"; and
how he refused a wife in France; and was
presented by King Alfred of Deira with a
monastery at Rhypum, here on this very
hill; and was consecrated at Compiègne in
a golden chair carried by singing bishops;
and how he converted the people of Bosham
by teaching them to fish with eel-nets, so
that "they began more readily at his preaching
to hope for heavenly goods"; and how
he won the day in the great controversy
at Whitby, and finally died as an archbishop
and was buried at the south end of
the altar here at Ripon. He was a very
human saint, and much beloved. His church
was destroyed by Edred, but his monastery
grew in power. The most beautiful part of
the present building is the Early English
west front, which dates from the reign of
Henry III.</p>

<p>Ripon is altogether charming, and still
does homage very prettily to its patron,
King Alfred, who made it a royal borough.
He it was who ordained that every night
a horn should be blown by the wakeman,
and that any one who was robbed between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the blowing of the horn and the hour of
sunrise should be repaid by the townsfolk.
From his day to ours each night at nine
o'clock the men of Ripon have heard the
horn&mdash;three long, penetrating blasts before
the town hall and three before the wakeman's
house. Several centuries ago the
wakeman became the mayor, and now he
blows the horn by deputy. "Except ye
Lord keep ye Cittie," are the words on the
town hall, "ye wakeman waketh in vain";
and not far away, at one corner of the
market-square, is a pretty old gabled house
bearing this legend: "1604. In thys house
lived a long time Hugh Ripley, ye last
Wakeman and first Mayore of Rippon."</p>

<p>Yet it is not these links with the beginnings
of our history, with Wilfrid the
Saxon saint and Alfred the Saxon king,
that draw so many people to Ripon.
Ripon has a greater attraction than these.
Only a few miles away is Fountains Abbey.</p>

<p class="b1">When approaching Fountains the motorist
may feel very thankful that a few additional
miles on the road are of little importance
to him. By choosing the longer way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
through the village of Studley Royal, he will
certainly save himself a considerable walk
and may possibly secure the unspeakable
blessing of solitude. The walk through the
park from the main entrance is, I know, regarded
as one of the chief beauties of the
place, with its Temple of Fame, and its Surprise
View, and its little cascades; but except
for the view of the Abbey, which is lovely,
these artificial prettinesses are more appreciated
by those who come forth on "an expedition"
than by those who really wish to
seize and keep something of the spirit of the
place. The distant abbey seen from the east
is part of a beautiful landscape, a satisfaction
to the eye, a picturesque incident in
the long glade; but those who approach it
from the west come upon it suddenly in all
its vastness, close at hand, and realise, probably
for the first time, something of the
splendour of the old monasteries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Here&mdash;in this long line of doorways, in
this enormous church which the choir of
birds still fills with sacred music, this
cloister-garth and chapter-house with the
rich archways, these stairs and domestic
buildings, wall beyond wall and room
beyond room&mdash;here truly was a power to
make a monarch jealous! It is no wonder
that Yorkshire, crowded as it was with
monasteries, thought a strength like theirs
might pit itself against the strength of the
king, and rose in protest against the Dissolution;
it is no wonder that the king's
agents could not find enough chains in the
country to hang the prisoners in. If this
vast skeleton is so magnificent, of what sort
was the actual life! Close your eyes for a
moment to it all, and think of the beginnings
of it.</p>

<p class="b1">Think of those thirteen monks, Prior
Richard and his brethren from St. Mary's
at York, hungering for a more perfect fulfilment
of their vows, who came here long
ago, when this green sward was "overgrown
with wood and brambles, more
proper for a retreat of wild beasts than
for the human species." Like wild beasts
they lived, with no shelter but the trees
and no food but herbs and leaves. They
worked with their hands by day, and kept
their vigils by night, "but of sadness or of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
murmuring there was not one sound," says
the monk who wrote their story, "but
every man blessed God with gladness."
They lived under the thatched yews till
they had raised a roof for themselves, but
even when that was accomplished they
were often on the point of starvation.
One day when all the food they had was
two loaves and a half, a beggar asked for
bread. "One loaf for the beggar," was Abbot
Richard's decree, "and one and a half for
the builders. For ourselves God will provide."
The cartload of bread which arrived
immediately afterwards as a gift from a
pious knight was the cause of much thankfulness
among the monks, but of little
surprise.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-060.jpg" width="400" height="556"
         alt=""

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">THE TOWER, FOUNTAINS ABBEY.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">As the years passed, lands and legacies
made the monastery rich. And so at last
this splendid fabric rose&mdash;a triumph of the
spirit over circumstances, a monument to
those long-buried monks whose toils and
sufferings are built into the mighty nave,
though surely they never dreamed of such
power and wealth as we are forced to
dream of as we stand amid this mass of
broken walls, now green with moss and
weeds, but once the heart of a huge organism.
It is a monument, too, to many who
came after the brave thirteen: to Abbot
Huby, who built the tower and is said to be
buried near it; to John of Kent, who gave
us the bewildering beauty of the Chapel of
the Nine Altars, one of the most exquisite
things ever wrought in stone: so spiritual,
so aspiring, that it seems to be a prayer
made visible, or even&mdash;with its slender
arrowy columns rising into the air till, like
fountains, they break into curves&mdash;to be the
embodiment of the abbey motto: <i>Benedicite
Fontes Domino</i>.</p>

<p>And while we are remembering those who
laboured for Fountains, do not let us forget
the man who died for it at Tyburn&mdash;William
Thirsk. This abbot was rash enough to
resist the messengers of Privy Seal, and was
accused by them of many things. He had,
they wrote, "gretly dilapidate his howse" by
theft and sacrilege, had sold the plate and
jewels of the abbey, and had not even secured
a proper price for them. To those who were
themselves bent upon theft and sacrilege on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
a large scale this last offence seemed worst
of all. He had actually, they declared contemptuously,
been persuaded by a jeweller
that a valuable ruby was a mere garnet;
"for the trewith ys he is a varra fole
and a miserable ideote." He joined in that
desperate protest the Pilgrimage of Grace,
and so was hanged.</p>

<p class="b1">Fortunately for posterity as well as for
himself, Thirsk's successor, Brodelay, who
was a creature of Thomas Cromwell and
chosen with a view to future events, was
not a "varra fole," and yielded meekly
when his abbey was demanded of him,
saving it from the fate of Jervaulx. As
it is, too much of it is gone&mdash;much that
might have been preserved. The cloisters
have vanished though the garth is there,
with the long flight of steps and the great
stone basin in the grass and the yew-tree
beside it; and gone, too, is the magnificent
infirmary, deliberately destroyed in the days
of James I. by the vandal who owned it
and was in want of some building material.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-064.jpg" width="400" height="254"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">FOUNTAINS HALL.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">One thing, however, still stands, which is,
perhaps, the last relic of the monks of
Fountains that we should expect to find,
and is certainly the most touching relic
possible&mdash;actually linking us with those
far-off days when the patient thirteen were
left here in the wilderness by Archbishop
Thurstan to keep their vow of poverty
with such terrible literalness. Over there,
beside the wall, is one of the yew-trees
whose boughs, covered with thatch, formed
the first monastery of Fountains.</p>

<p>Close to the western entrance is Fountains
Hall. Surely we must forgive that wicked
man who pulled down the infirmary, since
the place he built with the stones is this
lovely Jacobean house, a thing as beautiful
in its own domestic way as time-worn stone
and bays and mullions can make it. A balustrade,
a sundial, an old-fashioned garden and
ancient yew-hedge make the picture and our
pleasure complete.</p>

<p>There is a comfortable hotel at Ripon, and
as we have a great deal to see before reaching
any other desirable shelter, we shall find it
best, I think, to spend a night there either
before or after visiting Fountains. From the
windows of the <i>Unicorn</i>, on market-day, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
paved square is a gay and pleasant sight, with
its crowded stalls and bright awnings, and
stores of fruit and flowers and basket-work;
and here on a summer's night the horn-blower
may be dimly seen at nine o'clock
in his three-cornered hat and laced coat,
doing the bidding of Alfred the Great.</p>

<p>From Ripon there are three ways of reaching
Richmond, without taking into account
the direct route, which would show us
nothing of the dales we came out to see.
In either case we must go by Jervaulx
and Middleham and Wensley.</p>

<p>Only a few miles from Ripon is a village
less famous, but not less attractive, than any
of these: a spot well-known to antiquarians,
and doubtless to artists too, but unfamiliar
to ordinary folk. The charm of West Tanfield
catches the eye at once from the bridge that
spans the Ure, and comes as a pleasant surprise
in the midst of rather tame scenery.
The red-roofed cottages are grouped upon the
river-bank, with gay little gardens sloping to
the water's edge; behind them rises the
church tower, and the square grey gatehouse
of the Marmions, with its delicate oriel. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
gateway was built by Henry V.'s friend and
executor FitzHugh, who married one of the
Marmions and lived here, and added to the
church that held the splendid tombs of his
wife's ancestors. He was not buried here
himself, but by his own wish with curious
haste at Jervaulx. It is seldom that a little
village church possesses such monuments as
these of the Marmions, so rich in ornament
and so marvellously preserved: the arched
and canopied recess that holds the effigy of
Sir John; the cloaked and coronetted figure
of Maud his wife, who built this aisle and
founded chantries here; the emblazoned tomb
of the unknown lady with the lion; the
knight in mail; and the magnificent monument
of that other knight and his wife which
is probably a cenotaph in memory of John
and Elizabeth Marmion of the fourteenth
century. Their effigies lie, perfectly preserved,
under a light and graceful "hearse"
of ironwork, with seven sconces for candles&mdash;the
only iron hearse, they say, in England.
Every detail of the dress, every line of the
features, is distinct. The knight's aquiline
nose and full lips, rather sweet in expression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
are encircled by a gorget of mail, over whose
delicate links droop the ends of his long
moustache. A collar of SS clasps his throat.</p>

<p>On the north side of the chancel there is a
curious recess, with a squint into the nave
and two little windows into the choir. It is
unique, I believe, and as regards its origin
and uses very baffling.</p>

<p>Beyond West Tanfield the scenery grows in
beauty, for we are nearing the hills. Masham
lies prettily in a valley, with a setting of
moors and dales, gold and emerald when the
sun is shining, soft grey and green when the
day is dull. Skirting the little town we go
on our way to Jervaulx.</p>

<p>The site of Jervaulx is not beautiful, but
pleasant and peaceful. It lies in a private
park, so the car must wait beside the
gardener's cottage while we walk, borrowed
key in hand, across the field to the scattered
fragments of what was once a great Cistercian
abbey. Of the ruins tragically little was left
standing by the energetic commissioners of
Henry VIII., though they apologised for some
necessary delay in their congenial work.
"Pleasythe your lordship to be advertysed,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
wrote Thomas Cromwell's "most bounden
beadman" Richard Bellyseys, "I have taken
down all the lead of Jervaulx ... and the
said lead cannot be conveit nor carried until
the next sommre, for the ways in that countre
are so foul and deep that no caryage can pass
in wyntre. And as concerninge the taking
down of the house I am minded to let it stand
to the next spring of the year, by reason of
the days are now so short it wolde be double
charges to do it now." The work was finished
with great thoroughness at last, however, as
all may see. Of the church the barest outline
only is left, with the raised platform where
once the high altar stood, and near it the
broken figure that is said to represent the
Henry FitzHugh who did so much for West
Tanfield and left such strange orders about
his funeral. He desired to be buried at
Jervaulx with all possible haste after his
death. "To be carried thither by daylight,
if it come not too late; but if so, then the
same night." The land on which this community
first settled, at Fors, was the gift
of one of FitzHugh's ancestors, which may
account for his wish to be buried here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p class="b1">The case of the last abbot of Jervaulx,
Adam Sedbergh, was a sad one; for he
suffered the pains of martyrdom without
its exaltation, and while certainly failing to
please himself, pleased no one else. He was
a timid creature, apparently, and when Yorkshire
rose in the Pilgrimage of Grace, he was
so much afraid of king and rebels alike that
he simply ran away and hid. The rebel mob
came clamouring about the gates of Jervaulx,
crying: "Choose you a new abbot!" and
the frightened brothers gathered hurriedly
in the chapter-house. If we follow this
path, and turn down by these crumbling
steps, we may stand where they stood that
day; for there is more of the chapter-house
still in existence than of any other
part of the building. The roof that covered
the monks' bewildered heads is gone; but
here is the wide stone bench on which
they sat, trembling, through that hasty
conclave, and here are the columns and
the walls on which their eyes dwelt,
unseeingly, while the rebels threatened
them with fire at their gates and their
rightful leader was hiding in the heather.
They could think of no better course
than to seek the reluctant Adam, and
make a rebel of him whether he would
or no. They found him on the moors at
last, and lest his beautiful abbey should
be burnt to the ground because of him,
he came back to face the curses and
daggers of the mob, the futile sufferings
of rebellion, the prison-cell in the Tower
where his name still shows upon the
wall, and the gallows of Tyburn. His
tardy and unwilling heroism was piteously
useless, for not even the flames of the
Pilgrims of Grace could have laid the
walls of Jervaulx lower or left its altars
more desolate than did the hammers and
picks of the king's agents.</p>

<p class="p1">Charles Kingsley came here once, and picked
a forget-me-not for his wife&mdash;a pleasant
memory among so many fierce ones. He was
the last canon of the collegiate church of
Middleham, where he stayed for several days
at the time of his instalment, and endured
"so much bustle, and robing and unrobing"
that he had no time to think. Middleham,
as a rule, is anything but a bustling place;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
but in spite of its demure looks, I believe
there are still days when its streets are,
as Kingsley saw them, "crowded with
jockeys and grooms." We are now on
our way thither. After passing through
East Witton we cross the Cover, whose
pools are dear to fishermen, and were
therefore dear to Kingsley. "Little Cover,"
he called it affectionately, "in his deep
wooded glen, with his yellow rock and
bright white stones, and brown water
clearer than crystal."</p>

<p>We climb into Middleham past the base of
an old cross on which is fixed a modern head.
At the top of the hill is the curious structure
called the Swine Cross, with the mutilated
stone beast whose identity has proved so hard
to establish. Some say it is the Bear of
Warwick; others recognise in it the Boar of
Gloucester. As far as its personal appearance
is concerned it might with equal
plausibility be called the Lion of England
or the Hound of the Baskervilles, seeing that
its outline commits the sculptor to nothing
and it has no manner of face whatever.
Turning to the left we find the castle looking
down upon us gloomily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>This castle of Middleham is square and
stern; more strong than beautiful. Its
keep is Norman, and is the work of a
Fitzranulph of the twelfth century; but the
towered wall that hems it round so closely
was built by the Nevilles, who lived here
for many years in princely state. The
great Earl of Warwick, when he was not
making kings&mdash;and, indeed, sometimes when
he was&mdash;chose this to be a centre of his
pomp and power; and one of the kings he
made, Edward IV., is said to have been
imprisoned here for a short time. The time
would have been longer if Edward had not
cajoled his custodian, the Archbishop of
York, into allowing him to hunt in the
park. We know from <i>Henry VI.</i> how
Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and Lord
Hastings lay in ambush in the forest that
is no longer here, and rescued Edward from
those who were hunting with him.</p>

<p>That same Duke of Gloucester, who was
a trespasser on this occasion, came to
Middleham as its master later on. Poor
Anne Neville, the kingmaker's daughter,
spent most of her sad married life within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
this melancholy fortress, with the husband
who asked no man to make him king, but
made himself Richard III. We may see the
gloomy walls of her withdrawing room&mdash;bereft
now of both roof and floor&mdash;where
she sat so often sick at heart and ailing;
and the banquet-hall where her father kept
such state; and the kitchen where six oxen
were sometimes roasted for one breakfast.
There, in the north wall, is the gateway
through which she watched her husband
riding out to entrap his little nephews, and
through which she herself soon followed
him to see him crowned; and here at the
south-west corner of the outer wall is the
tower where her only son was born. The
boy spent practically all his short life here,
all but that brief and brilliant interlude
of the coronation at Westminster and the
pageantry at York; and here, too, he died
in his parents' absence. I do not know if
Anne ever returned to Middleham. We
hear of her "in a state bordering on madness,"
and not long afterwards her tragic
life was over.</p>

<p>For many years the castle was left at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
mercy of all who cared to despoil it. It
was very literally treated as a quarry; for
when all the faced stone within reach had
been removed the walls were hollowed out
below, in the hope that the upper part
might fall and so provide more plunder.
Such is the cohesion of the masonry, however,
that this design was more or less
frustrated, and the undermined walls still
stand like overhanging cliffs. Here and
there, indeed, great masses have fallen in
huge boulders as solid as rock; but perhaps
the gunpowder of the Commonwealth was
responsible for these.</p>


<p>There was once a suggestion made, in a
letter from Lord Huntingdon to his "verrye
good lord ye lord Treasurer," that Queen
Elizabeth should join in this work of
quarrying. She purposed to pay a visit to
her city of York, a visit which was designed
to be "no small comforte to all hyr
good subjects, and no less terrour to ye
others." But the great difficulty was to
find "a good housse" for her. Huntingdon
excitedly laid his scheme before Burleigh.
"Ye meanes ys thys," he wrote. "Hyr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
hyghness hathe heare ye Castell of Midham,
which ys in greate ruyne and daylye
wasteth, ... but ye tymber ye stone ye
lead and ye iron yt ys theare wold make
a fayre housse heare, and as I gesse with
good husbandrye paye all ye chargys. I am
sure if your L. dyd see ye place ... you
wolde thinke yt most convenient to be
pulled downe, rathyr than yt shuld stande
and waste daylye as yt dothe."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Fortunately
Burleigh did not think it most convenient,
and now the place no longer wastes
daily, but is daily being repaired.</p>

<p>When we crossed Cover Bridge we entered
Wensleydale, and a mile or two beyond
Middleham is the pretty little town from
which the dale takes its name. The scenery
is quiet and pastoral here, the Ure flows
smoothly, and it is difficult to realise how
near we are to the sort of country Defoe
was thinking of when he wrote in
his eighteenth-century way: "The black
moorish lands show dismal and frightful."
How near we are to the moorish lands,
however, we shall shortly find out, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
is at Wensley that we have to decide by
which road we shall cross them.</p>

<p>But first, here is Wensley Church on the
left, with Saxon stones in it, and a splendid
brass that no one who cares for such things
would wish to pass by, and among its
graves one that has been thought to be of
interest to every British man and woman.
It is an altar-tomb with fluted corners
standing on the right of the path that leads
from gate to porch. Beneath it lies Peter
Goldsmith. It has been stated,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> on what
grounds I cannot discover, that he was
surgeon of the <i>Victory</i> at Trafalgar, and
that Nelson died in his arms. This is
making a great claim for him. Yet his
name is not mentioned in the standard
accounts of Nelson's death,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> nor does it
appear in the list of the <i>Victory's</i> officers.
As we all know, Beatty was the surgeon
who attended Nelson in the cockpit. The
assistant-surgeon was Neil Smith; the
surgeon's mate was Westerburgh.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the country of the Scropes of
Bolton, and their names and arms are conspicuous
in the church&mdash;over the porch, on
the buttresses, on the carved chancel stalls,
and, above all, on Lord Bolton's screened
pew in the north aisle. The carved sides of
this were originally part of the parclose
by which the tombs of the Scropes were
surrounded in Easby Abbey. The front of
it is ugly and has an eighteenth-century
air. The horrible grey marbled paint that
defaces the woodwork suggests the nineteenth.
The famous brass, which lies within
the communion rails, is so beautiful as to
appeal to the most ignorant in such matters,
and dates from the fourteenth century. It
marks the grave of two men&mdash;Sir Simon
of Wensley, priest, and the seventeenth-century
rector who desired to be buried
under the same stone and brass.</p>

<p>Our course, after leaving Wensley, depends
on our further intentions. The course I
recommend is this: to drive up Wensleydale
on the lower road, past the cascades
and village of Aysgarth&mdash;named by the
Danes Asgard, the home of the gods&mdash;past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Bainbridge and Hawes; to cross the river
at Yorebridge, and return by Askrigg and
Redmire, making a short digression to
Bolton Castle; then, turning to the left
beyond Redmire, to strike across the
"moorish lands" to Richmond. These Yorkshire
moors, which seemed so "ill-looking"
to Defoe, are neither black nor frightful
in our later eyes, but glorious with colour
and light. The old road from Leyburn
across Barden and Hipswell Moors has
rather a bad surface, and a hill that is stiff
enough to account for the making of the
new road; but on a sunny summer's evening
the view from the highest point is lovely
beyond words. Beautiful it must be at all
seasons and in all weathers, but it is only
when the air is clear that the head of
Swaledale may be seen on one side of the
ridge and the far-away slopes of Wensleydale
on the other, and it is only when the
sun is sinking that those distant hills are
washed with gold. The moors sweep round
us far and near; a line of dark firs crosses
them mid-way; patches of vivid green
break through the heather; and down in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the valley the Swale shows as a thin thread
of twisted silver. Behind us, towards
Middleham, the more level country is a
dark blue streak beyond the crimson of the
sunlit heather. The white road, straight
and narrow, lies before us.</p>

<p>Those who choose this way will have
little to regret, and will have one real
advantage: they will approach Richmond
by the road which gives the finest view of
that fair town. They must remember, however,
that there is a very steep downward
gradient at one point between the moors
and the river, and at the bottom of it a
sharp turn over a bridge. The run up
Swaledale may easily be achieved from
Richmond, where there is a comfortable
hotel.</p>

<p>The other alternative is to cross from
Wensleydale to Swaledale by way of the
Buttertubs Pass. Now, I do not wish to be
too encouraging about this pass! It is a
place for the well-equipped only, and for
those who do not suffer too much when
their tyres are suffering. Many cars, of
course, have passed this way, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
more will do so; but none the less it is not
a suitable road for motoring. It is precipitous
in places, narrow everywhere, and
the surface is almost entirely composed of
loose stones. Moreover, a grassy slope, so
steep as to be almost a precipice, drops
away from the edge of it; and though I
am assured the pass is perfectly safe, there
are points in it where nothing but faith in
one's driver can make it comfortable! The
scenery is magnificent.</p>

<p>Starting from Wensley, we must take the
upper of the two roads to Redmire marked on
Bartholomew's map, for the lower one, apparently,
runs through Lord Bolton's park. It
occurs to one here, as in several other places
in Yorkshire, that it would be a good plan
if map-makers would adopt some distinctive
way of marking private roads. The views
from the high ground are lovely. All Wensleydale
lies before us&mdash;green as an emerald
in the valley, bare and grey on the hilltops,
dimly blue in the distance. Over it all lies
that haze of luminous gold that the sunshine
gives to these dales. Far away, but clearly
visible, Bolton Castle stands up on the hillside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
massive and grey and relentless, a
queen's prison. At Redmire Station we turn
aside to see it.</p>

<p class="b1">"The castelle," says Leland, "as no great
howse, is al compactid in 4 or 5 towers."
Outwardly, it is probably much the same as
in his day: a square of cold, grey stone with
a tower at each corner, gloomy and forbidding,
with no attempt at ornament, no break in the
solid masonry except the tiny windows. To
Leland it was simply the castle of the Scropes,
the work of the famous Chancellor who
fought at Créçy in his younger days, the
fortress of a family that was perpetually
distinguishing itself. So he looked at it and
passed it by. It was "no great howse."
But we see it with other eyes, because it has
been touched by the charm that wins us in
spite of our better judgment, just as it won
men long ago in spite of theirs&mdash;the glamour
of the Queen of Scots. The banquet hall
where so many Scropes have feasted&mdash;bishops,
statesmen, judges, Knights of the Garter&mdash;leaves
us cold; we do not care to know
there was a chantry here; even the cruel
dungeon in the ground, with the hole through
which the victim was lowered and the bolt
to which he was fastened and the slab of
stone that was fixed over the top, only
calls for a passing shudder. To us the
interest of Bolton Castle is centred in the
whitewashed room upstairs.</p>

<p class="p1">It was a summer evening, "one hour after
sunsetting," when Mary rode into that grass-grown
court with Sir Francis Knollys and
Sir George Bowes, and two companies of
soldiers, and six ladies, and forty-three
horses, and four cartloads of luggage. She
was not yet very unhappy. "She hath been
very quiet," wrote Knollys of the journey,
"very tractable, and void of displeasant
countenance." She was less tractable when
the time came for her to leave Bolton: she
had learnt much meanwhile. For the months
spent at Bolton were the crisis of her misfortunes.
In this upper room she sat
"knitting of a work" in the deep recess of
the window, or writing endless letters by
the fire, or turning young Christopher
Norton's head, while the Casket Letters
were being read at Hampton Court, and
her accusers were discussing her character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
at York, and her "dear cousin and
sister" was pressing her to abdicate her
throne. It was in this room that she wrote
at last to her advisers: "I pray you do
not speak to me again about abdication,
for I am deliberately resolved rather
to die than to resign my crown; and
the last words that I shall utter in my
life shall be the words of a Queen of
Scotland."</p>

<p>She wrote a vast number of other letters
here. Some were to the young Queen of
Spain, her sister-in-law, who, as Elizabeth
of France, had been her playmate at the
Court of Henri II.; some were about the
care of her infant son; and some, of a conciliatory
kind, were to the Queen of England.
"Toutesfoyes," she wrote, "sur votre parolle
il n'est rien que je n'entreprisse, car je ne
doutay jamays de votre honneur et royalle
fidelitay."</p>

<p class="b1">It was here, too, that she wrote her first
English letter to her custodian, Sir Francis
Knollys&mdash;her schoolmaster, as she called him,
who had been giving her lessons, apparently
without any marked success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">"It is sed Seterday my unfrinds wil be wth

<p class="p1">Mary's rooms have lately been restored;
but this plain stone fireplace is the same by
which she sat shivering while the news of
the Westminster Conference was so long in
coming through the snow, hoping against
hope that the English Queen would not
"make her lose all"; turning over in her
mind the scheme for marrying her to Don
John of Austria; reading specious letters
from Elizabeth pleading "the natural love of
a mother towards her bairn"; and smiling
upon Knollys till he credited her with "an
eloquent tongue, a discreet head, a stout
courage, and a liberal heart adjoined thereunto."
This is the window through which
she looked out over Wensleydale, luminous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in the August sunshine or white with snow,
and realised gradually that she was indeed
a prisoner, she who "loved greatly to go on
horseback." She was allowed to ride in the
park, it is true; but her riding was a
mockery with twelve soldiers at her horse's
heels.</p>

<p>Yet she was not always sad. She had
her lighter moments and pastimes other than
knitting. "The Queen here is merry, and
hunteth," wrote Knollys, "and passeth
her time in pleasant manner." She even
coquetted with the Reformed Faith, and
"grew into a good liking of the Liturgy";
and she took pleasure (of a more convincing
kind) in having her hair busked by Mistress
Mary Seaton, whom she declared to be the
finest busker in any country. Knollys, apparently,
was not insensible to the charms of
a <i>coiffure</i>. "This day she did set such a
curled hair upon the Queen that it was like
to be a periwig that showed very delicately;
and every other day she hath a new device
of hairdressing, without any cost, and yet
setteth forth a woman gaily well."</p>

<p>Here, up these steps upon which Mary's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
skirts have trailed, is the room where Mistress
Seaton set such a curled hair upon the lovely
head, the room where the Queen slept, or
more often lay awake. There had been some
difficulty in making her rooms ready to receive
her. The Scropes were not luxurious, it
seems. Her bedding and hangings came
from Sir George Bowes' house, near Barnard
Castle; pewter vessels and a copper kettle
were hastily borrowed from the Court of
England; and the neighbours lent some
furniture with rather a bad grace. There
is a very strong local tradition that Mary
once escaped from Bolton Castle. The
"Queen's Gap" on Leyburn Shawl is pointed
out as the scene of her recapture, and this
little bedroom window as the way of her
escape. I cannot find the least evidence that
the story is true. But it was in this room
that she lay sick for days, before she was
dragged reluctantly away in the dusk of
a January dawn, bitterly cold and bitterly
angry, to her next prison at Tutbury.</p>

<p>This castle held for the king in the Civil
War, and that is why it has lost its north-west
tower. The actual fall was in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
storm, a hundred years later than the
siege that weakened the masonry.</p>

<p class="b1">As we drive away up Wensleydale we
look back again and again at the fortress,
which dominates the valley far more conspicuously
than its position on the green
hillside seems to warrant. The scenery
grows wilder and the slopes nearer before
a steep descent with a bad surface takes
us into Askrigg. Here, in a little open
space beside the church, is a picturesque
Jacobean house of grey stone, bearing an
inscription and the date <span class="smcap">mdclxxviii</span>. Its
projecting bays are joined by a wooden
gallery, which was designed, it is said, to
give a good view of the bull-baiting that
took place before it. There, hidden in the
grass, is the iron ring to which the bull
was tied; and close beside it stands the
restored village-cross&mdash;a strange conjunction
of symbols! In the fifteenth-century
church there are some pillars which are
thought to have been transported from
Fors, the original dwelling, about a mile
from here, of the brothers of Jervaulx&mdash;the
little band of monks from Savigny,
who came to this valley under the leadership
of Peter de Quincy, the Leech, in the
reign of Stephen. They found this place
too wild even for their Cistercian ideals,
too cold and foggy for the ripening of
crops, too frequently beset by wolves; and
so, though the optimistic Peter was "very
certain we shall be able to raise a competent
supply of ale, cheese, bread, and
butter," the community moved nearer to
civilisation, leaving behind them nothing
for us to see except a window in a barn
and these pillars in Askrigg Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">As the road becomes narrower and
rougher the scenery every moment grows
more beautiful. Hawes lies on the other
side of the valley at the foot of the blue
hills, in a lovely position beside the Ure;
and when we have reached a point exactly
opposite to it we turn sharply up a steep
pitch on the right, with a splendid panoramic
view of mountains on the left as
we climb.</p>

<p class="b1">This is the beginning of the Buttertubs
Pass. From this point onwards, till the
road plunges down into Swaledale, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
surface is composed more or less of loose
stones. The stiffest upward gradients we
shall have to encounter are within a mile
or two of this spot, for the wild part of
the pass&mdash;the real moorland&mdash;is comparatively
level, and by the time we reach the
actual Buttertubs we are already running
down. This is the climax&mdash;this point
where the downward gradient begins&mdash;for
here suddenly the solid earth seems to fall
away from us: here suddenly the rough
and narrow road is no longer lying across
the far-stretching moorland, but is hanging
high upon the hillside, clinging upon the
extremest edge of a gulf which drops
dizzily into a blue sea of shadows. Thus
it clings for miles. Beyond the chasm the
bare hillside rises again above our heads
in magnificent curves, glowing with colour,
and cleft here and there into purple
gorges. Slightly above the road on the
left are the Buttertubs, strange crater-like
hollows of unplumbed depth, appearing at
intervals beside us, with sharp rocks bristling
through the grass at their mouths.
As we slowly descend, the hills of Swaledale
rise before us like a wall blocking the
defile; and presently a gate across the road
shows that we are near the world again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Truly this is one of the runs that are
unforgettable. To be among these savage
heights and depths, these heaving waves of
desolate moor, to have these solitudes above
us and these blue shadows so far below us,
is to know something of "the strong foundations
of the earth." It is with a feeling
of anti-climax that we close the gate
behind us, and, on a precipitous gradient
and no surface worth mentioning, steer
slowly down into Swaledale.</p>

<p>As we cautiously make our way over the
stones of this very trying lane, we are
confronted with rather a startling notice
board: "No Road." It seems a little late
to tell us that now: they might have mentioned
it before we crossed the pass! Then
it dawns upon us that the amateur hand
that traced the letters has sloped the board
in the wrong direction. It is really meant
to face down the valley, for the discouragement
of those who might stray up from
Swaledale, ignorant of the pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p class="b1">Swaledale, I think, is the most beautiful
of all the dales. Of course beauty varies
with the weather, and distant Muker in the
hollow of the hills cannot be the same on
a colourless, grey day as when it lies in a
pool of sunshine. But on any day Swaledale
must seem, to one who is fresh from
the elemental dignity of the pass, to hold
a wonderful variety of lovely things: opal
hills and soft woods, patches of heather
and slopes of fern, fir-trees and feathery
birches and clumps of scarlet rowans. There
are individual pictures that one remembers
as types of the whole. At Gunnerside, for
instance, where the road crosses the Swale,
cliffs rise from the stony river-bed, and are
crowned with overhanging trees, the banks
are smothered in masses of burdock leaves,
and the whole scene is encircled by the
hills. The road is not very good, and there
are some steep pitches between Gunnerside
and Reeth; but it matters little, for who
would care to hurry through such a land
as this?</p>

<p class="p1 b1">It was on the road near Low Row that
John Wesley began his preaching in this
part of the world, standing on a table by
the wayside. A little further on is Helaugh,
once a gayer place than it is at
present. The hills above it have echoed
many a time to the winding of the horn,
when John of Gaunt was lord here and
went out to chase the boar. Later on
these lands belonged to that strange Duke
of Wharton, "the scorn and wonder" of
Pope's day, who was a Whig when it was
unfashionable and a Jacobite when it
became dangerous, who fought against his
country and died a monk.</p>

<p class="ppq10">"Ask you why Wharton broke through every rule?<br />
'Twas all for fear the Knaves should call him Fool."</p>

<p class="p1">At Reeth, a fascinating place built on a
slope at the mouth of Arkengarth Dale, we
cross the river again, and find a much
better road on the other side.</p>

<p>Between Reeth and Richmond the Swale,
flowing softly past its richly wooded banks,
is as beautiful as the lower Wye. On the
further side of it we see the Norman tower
of Marrick Priory, where once twelve blackrobed
nuns lived only a mile away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
their "white-clothid" sisters of Ellerton.
The nuns of Marrick were fortunate, for
though they were so few they won a short
respite for some unknown reason, and were
allowed to stay in their beautiful retreat
till the dissolution of the larger monasteries.
There are few places in England,
I think, that would be easier to love and
harder to leave than Swaledale.</p>

<p>Richmond, on its hill, guards the mouth
of the valley. This first view of it from
Swaledale, with the tower of the castle
rising slowly into sight, gives no idea at
all of the beauty and strength that have
made it famous. We only know how Richmond
has won its name when we see it
from below, with the buttressed bridge in
the foreground, and the bright waters of
the Swale reflecting the houses that are
clustered at their brink, and the sun-flecked
path under the trees, and the roofs, tier
above tier, climbing the steep hillside, and
above them all&mdash;foe of their foes and
shelter of their friends&mdash;the long curtain-wall
and towering keep of the castle. This
view of Richmond has been praised so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
much that one fears disappointment. Yet
one is not disappointed. Richmond is not
only beautiful: it has that other quality&mdash;so
much more important than beauty in
woman or town&mdash;the quality of charm.
Richmond is lovable.</p>

<p>It was the Normans who first took advantage
of this fine position for a fortress:
the Saxon owners of the place were the
Earls of Mercia, and had no castle here, for
Gilling, their headquarters in the north,
was only a few miles away. We may
dream, if we like, that Ethelfled, the soldierly
daughter of Alfred the Great, and
Godiva, the Lady of Coventry, visited this
place when their husbands were minded to
chase the wolf or the boar in this part of
their lands. It is possible that they did
so: but there is no authentic history of
Richmond before the time when Alan the
Breton received from his kinsman, William
the Conqueror, "at the siege before York,"
a grant of "all the towns and lands which
lately belonged to Earl Edwin in Yorkshire."
It was this Alan who began to
build the castle. We may not enter it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
without permission, for it is now used as
barracks; but we can walk up to the
gateway at the foot of the great keep and
see its buttresses and turrets towering
above us; and we can follow the path that
surrounds the walls and look at the view
that George IV. admired so much. This
view of the river from the castle is very
pretty, but is by no means comparable to
the view of the castle from the river.
Possibly George IV. fixed his eyes upon the
Culloden Tower among the trees to the right,
and was biassed by association.</p>

<p class="b1">Three times this castle wall behind us
has imprisoned a king. When five English
knights and their men-at-arms made their
dashing march to Alnwick and captured
William the Lion of Scotland, it was to
Richmond they brought him; and David
Bruce, another Scottish king, was here
nearly two hundred years later; and the
third was Charles I. Legend, indeed, tells
us of a fourth king still imprisoned here;
for this castle rock is one of the many
places wherein King Arthur lies asleep with
all his knights, awaiting the magic blast
upon the horn that shall some day wake
him. The Breton folk say he waits beneath
the island of Agalon; the Welsh look for
him to come forth from among the mountains
of Glamorganshire.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-108.jpg" width="400" height="284"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">RICHMOND.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Soon after Bruce's imprisonment the castle
seems to have fallen into disrepair; and
this, I suppose, was the reason that John
of Gaunt, who was Lord of Richmond, made
his hunting expeditions from Helaugh
rather than from here. Harry of Richmond,
when he became Henry VII., gave
this castle of his to his mother, and finding
that the "mantill wall" was "in decay of
maisone wark," and "all the doyers, wyndoys,
and other necessaries," with much beside,
were also in decay, he gave orders that
the whole should "be new refresshede."</p>

<p>Though this attractive town possesses
much, it has also lost much. Once it had
a wall&mdash;built to keep the Scots out&mdash;and
several gates; but all are gone now, except
the postern in Friar's Wynd, and the old
pointed arch of Bargate, which we may see
from the foot of Carnforth Hill. Gone, too,
is the elaborate cross, which, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
all accounts, was an object of beauty in
the paved market-place. This is more than
can be said for the strange obelisk that has
supplanted it. But in this same market-square
still stands Holy Trinity Chapel&mdash;not
beautiful, but very ancient, being that
"chapel in Richemont toune" which, Leland
says, had "straung figures in the waulles of
it. The people there dreme," he goes on,
"that it was ons a temple of idoles." Some
even dream that this chapel was founded
by Paulinus, the seventh-century saint, in
memory of an occasion when he baptized
an enormous number of converts in the
Swale; but, as Bede says the ceremony took
place in the river because it was impossible
to build oratories "in those parts," this
dream is not very credible. It is no dream,
I believe, but a fact, that the chapel stands
on the site of a Danish temple. In its
walls there are now no strange figures of
"idoles," but some very strange <i>annexes</i> for
a chapel. A butcher's shop is wedged
between the tower and the nave, and
several other shops are built into its side.</p>

<p>One of the most notable things here is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the Grey Friars' Tower, which we passed
on entering the town from Swaledale: a
peculiarly slender and graceful piece of
Perpendicular work. Like the campanile
at Evesham, it stands alone because the
building of the church connected with it
was suddenly brought to an end by the
Dissolution. The Franciscans who had their
friary here were mostly put to death or
imprisoned for life&mdash;yet not for long&mdash;because
they thought it their duty to obey
St. Francis rather than Henry VIII.</p>

<p>There are remains of another religious
house quite close to Richmond. Very little
is left at Easby of the abbey church of
St. Agatha, but the position of the ruins
beside the river is full of quiet charm.
Those who dwelt here were Premonstratensian
Canons, whose rather confusing
order was founded by the German visionary
St. Norbert, and whose white garments
were chosen for them by the Virgin herself.
They passed to their dormitory
through the Norman archway with the
ornamented mouldings, the last remaining
fragment of the original twelfth-century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
building raised by Roald, the Constable of
Richmond. Until lately a very decorative
tree grew up through this archway and
figured in every picture of Easby, but it
threatened to break down the masonry, and
so was sacrificed. It is a sad loss to artists.
But the last memorial of Roald would have
been a loss still sadder, for, even as it is,
Roald is often forgotten in favour of the
Scropes, who practically rebuilt St. Agatha's.
Their shield is still over the porch of the
parish church, a hundred yards away; their
dust lies under the rough sods to the west of
the north transept. At Wensley we saw the
carved sides of what was once their parclose.</p>

<p>We finally leave the town by the same
road that leads to Easby, turning off to the
left to join the great Roman highway beyond
Gilling. It was just here, where the roads
fork, that the Lass of Richmond Hill lived
in the eighteenth century, till she married the
writer of the song; and hither, too, to the
same Hill House, came later songs, greater
than MacNally's&mdash;songs from Byron to his
future wife, Miss Milbank. Our last view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Richmond, from <i>Maison Dieu</i>, is worthy of
remembrance. The town is spread before us
with all its towers; the slender Grey Friars'
Tower, the church, the soaring keep; and in
the background of hills is the green gap that
means so much to those who have lost their
hearts to Swaledale. That is behind us now;
and on the right is stretched the great green
plain of central Yorkshire&mdash;the plain that
divides the western moors from the moors
of Clevedon and Hambledon. Somewhere
in that plain is the Great North Road.</p>

<p>Soon after passing Lord Zetland's place,
Aske Hall, we drive through the wide street
of Gilling, the little village of gardens, where
there is nothing left, except a few Saxon
stones, to remind us that the great Earls of
Mercia made it one of their capitals till Alan
of Brittany laid it waste. A little way
beyond it we turn a sharp corner and are
on the Roman road. After speeding along
this for some minutes it is interesting to
look back and see the amazing straightness
of the white streak that stretches away
behind the car and disappears over the crest
of the hill. The scenery is dull at first; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
presently a new line of moors and dales
appears on the horizon, and the roadway
itself is shaded with trees and fringed with
grass and flowers. Meantime the surface is
enough in itself to make a motorist happy.</p>

<p class="b1">The car glides up the slope of a little
bridge; we pass a screen of trees; and the
extreme beauty of the Greta is revealed with
a suddenness that is almost startling. This
bridge with the stone parapet is the famous
Greta Bridge; this is the stream painted by
Turner and sung by Scott; there by the roadside
are the gates of Rokeby.</p>

<p class="ppq20">
"Oh, Brignall banks are fresh and fair,<br />
And Greta woods are green!"</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Brignall banks are not in sight, but here are
Greta woods&mdash;intensely green&mdash;flinging their
branches across the river till they meet and
interlace in an archway over the clear water
and the yellow stones.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-116.jpg" width="400" height="278"
         alt=""

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">GRETA BRIDGE.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">At the northern limit of Rokeby Park we
must leave the highway. There is a road
here that is not marked on Bartholomew's
map&mdash;a road that turns to the right and leads
to Mortham Tower, and the Dairy Bridge,
and the meeting of the Greta and the Tees.
The "battled tower" of Mortham is now
inhabited; we may not see the bloodstains
on the stairs; but from a little distance the
fifteenth-century peel and the Tudor buildings
that surround it make a pretty group.
Below the grassy knoll on which it stands
the Greta dashes down between its overshadowing
banks and veiling foliage to join
the quieter, statelier Tees.</p>

<p>The beauty of this place is really haunting.
Sir Walter Scott has described every inch of
it in "Rokeby," with complete accuracy if
with no great inspiration. For the wild
sweetness of this spot is not such as can be
put into words. It is a place of enchantment,
where the spell-bound poet can only
stammer helplessly, and the plain man for
a moment feels himself a poet.</p>

<p class="b1">Returning to the main road, we follow the
wooded Tees to Barnard Castle. For miles
the river is as we saw it at the meeting of
the waters, darkly shadowed by trees and
bound by rocky banks; more beautiful in
itself than Wharfe or Swale, though flowing
through a valley that cannot be compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to the other dales except at its head: but
there, I think, excelling them all. Through
the greater part of Teesdale the beauty of
the river is so closely confined to its banks
that we only catch a glimpse of it now and
then, when actually crossing the stream.
One of these glimpses we have from the
toll-bridge just below Eggleston Abbey,
where we cross for a few minutes into the
county of Durham. The ruins of the abbey
are visible through the trees, standing on a
grassy hill upon the Yorkshire bank of the
river.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-120.jpg" width="400" height="564"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">THE DAIRY BRIDGE.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">At Barnard Castle&mdash;which is not a very
attractive town at first sight, and is sorely
disfigured by its portentous museum&mdash;we
again cross the Tees into Yorkshire, near
the point where the familiar towers of the
Baliols' ruined fortress stand high above
the river on their cliff. This commanding
position was granted to the Norman Guy
de Baliol by Rufus, and Guy's son Bernard
raised on it the castle that was forfeited by
his descendant. This Bernard was no friend
to the throne on which the later Baliol sat,
for he was the most zealous of the five
knights who captured William of Scotland
and took him to Richmond Castle. When
the enterprise seemed about to fail, it was
Bernard who cried: "If you should all turn
back, I would go on alone!" A little more
than a hundred years later John Baliol, King
of Scotland, was rashly refusing to be at the
beck and call of the English king. "Has the
fool done this folly?" asked Edward. "If
he will not come to us we will come to him!"
So John lost his crown, and Barnard Castle
saw the Baliols no more. It was given to the
Nevilles, and so with many other things fell
into the capacious hands of Richard III., who
actually lived here for a time, and has left
his symbol, the wild boar, upon the oriel
window.</p>

<p>There is one gracious memory that makes
these towers sacred. The ruined halls are
haunted by the presence of that gentle and
sad lady who was the widow of one John
Baliol and the mother of another&mdash;Devorgilla,
daughter of kings, foundress of Baliol
College, and in her endless sorrow the builder
of Dulce Cor. When her husband died she
"had his dear heart embalmed and enshrined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
in a coffer of ivory, enamelled and bound
with silver bright, which was placed before
her daily in her hall as her sweet, silent companion."
It was here at Bernard Castle that
she chiefly lived with that silent companion,
until the noble shrine of stone was ready to
receive the ivory coffer; it was here she
lived on alone, till she too died and was
carried out to be buried in Sweetheart
Abbey, with John Baliol's "dear heart"
upon her breast.</p>

<p>Of the two roads to Middleton-in-Teesdale
the one on the Durham side is the best as
regards both surface and scenery; but the
greater number of those who drive up
Teesdale will return to Barnard Castle
before going on their way to the north or
crossing Yorkshire to the coast, and will
probably prefer to drive up the valley by
one road and come down it again on
the other. On the Yorkshire side there
is nothing very striking. Lartington is
pretty, and gay with flowers; Cotherstone
still has a fragment of the FitzHughs'
castle in a field above the
river; Romaldkirk has an interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
church. Beyond Mickleton we cross the
Lune, which is a miniature copy of the
Tees, with the same rocky bed and the
same close screen of overarching boughs.
A few minutes later we cross the Tees
itself and are in Middleton.</p>

<p>The road from Middleton to High Force
is surprisingly populous. Here among the
hills, where the fields are yielding to moorland,
and the river flows under bare crags,
one expects a certain amount of loneliness;
yet here is a broad and civilised highway,
with all the character of a road near some
large town. The scenery, however, is wild
enough; and more beautiful than anything
we have seen. Beyond the river&mdash;open now
to the sky, no longer veiled by trees&mdash;rise
the moors, piled high, fold upon fold, grand
in outline and glorious in colour, green and
purple and crimson. A wood by the wayside
blots out river and hills for a moment; then
suddenly through a gap we see High Force.</p>

<p class="b1">Looking down from the road we see it as
a picture framed in trees: the solid wall of
rock, the leap of the foaming waters, the
cloud of spray, the fir-trees with their spires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
against the sky, the crimson moors beyond.
That white torrent is the boundary of the
county, the crown and climax of the beauty
of Yorkshire, and our last and most perfect
memory of the dales.</p>

<p class="pn center p4 large">II</p>

<p class="pn center large">THE COAST</p>

<p class="pn p2">When one is approaching the coast of
Yorkshire from the north, the important
thing is to avoid the manufacturing
towns of Stockton and Middlesbrough. This
can be done by crossing the Tees at Yarm,
and joining the splendid road that runs so
straightly from this point to the sea. Those
who have come from the dales will notice
at once, even in Yarm, how greatly the
houses here differ from the houses of the
west. In that fair land the buildings, both
small and great, have the character common
to moorland buildings: they are stern and
sturdy and grey; made not to please the
eye, but to endure the buffetings of wind
and rain. But these houses of the plain,
it seems, do their best to provide the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
beauty that is lacking in scenery. They are
warm and picturesque, red and tiled and
gabled, a feature in the landscape. The
wide street of Yarm, with its trees and
grass and pretty buildings, has almost a
foreign air. Beyond it is the straight road
with the magnificent surface.</p>

<p>The views from this road, to right and
left, are rather striking, each in its own
way. On the left the scene is not beautiful,
yet not without romance&mdash;the romance that
is hidden under so much that is ugly. That
long, long line of tall chimneys and distant
masts, that cloud of smoke that darkens
all the sky, are symbols of the spirit
of adventure, of the love of enterprise, of
untiring progress, of belief in the future;
for surely the history of our commerce has
included all these things. It was from
Stockton that the first railway in the world
ran to Darlington; and in Middlesbrough
many of our merchant ships are built.
Eighty years ago about a hundred people
lived there: to-day there are a hundred
thousand under that black pall.</p>

<p>To the right of us is an equally long line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of another sort&mdash;the line of the Cleveland
Moors. The curious excrescence of Roseberry
Topping is conspicuous from the first,
and even at this distance the monument to
Captain Cook is visible on the hillside. For
it was in the little village of Marton,
through which we pass on our way to
Guisborough, that James Cook was born,
and learnt his lessons in the village school
when not employed in scaring crows. Roseberry
Topping, at first sight, looks like a
huge tumulus. "It is the landmark that
directs sailers, and a prognostick to the
neighbours hereabouts." The view from
its summit has been described by many
writers, with degrees of enthusiasm varying
from the "most agreeable prospect" of
Camden to the ardour of another traveller,
who declared that "there you may see a
vewe the like whereof I never saw, or
thinke that any traveller hath seene any
comparable unto yt." A certain discreet
author, quoting these words a hundred
years ago, says gravely: "Accurate observation
and comparison forbid us to ratify this
assertion in its full extent."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The base of Roseberry Topping is largely
composed of alum. In the reign of
Elizabeth some alum works were set up at
Guisborough, but were solemnly cursed by
the Pope. His Holiness, it transpired, was
himself the owner of some alum works.</p>

<p>The actual streets of Guisborough are
not attractive, but seen from a distance the
general effect of the little place is rather
charming. It lies in a valley with the hills
of Cleveland behind it, and towering above
it is the great east window of its priory,
bereft so entirely of tracery that it has
the air of some stately gateway. This
lovely fragment, this graceful window with
its pinnacles and crockets, is all, except a
Norman gateway, that is left of the burial-place
of the English Bruces&mdash;the once rich
and famous Augustinian priory whose buildings
covered acres of ground, and whose
prior "kept a most pompous house." At
least two churches that have stood upon
this spot were destroyed by fire, but it was
not fire that caused this final destruction;
not, as in one of the other cases, the
conduct of "a vile plumber with a wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
disposition"; not even primarily the zeal of
Henry VIII.'s commissioner; but the vandalism
of one Chaloner, who bought it and
hacked it to pieces. It was he who built
the alum works that were so distasteful to
the Pope, and it is quite possible that some
of the stones of this Gothic masterpiece
were used for the purpose. If this were
the case, one could forgive the Pope for his
methods of carrying on business.</p>

<p>At Skelton, over there on the hill, lived
the Bruces of the English branch, who
founded the priory. Margaret Tudor,
daughter of Henry VII. and wife of
James IV. of Scotland, raised a splendid
cenotaph here to her husband's ancestors,
the Bruces of Annandale and Skelton, only
a short time before her brother made the
place desolate for ever. The cenotaph was
moved to the parish church, and was
broken up in the eighteenth century. Until
quite lately pieces of it were scattered in
various parts of the church and priory, but
it has now been restored with great care
and set up near the west door of the church,
with all its statues of Scottish and English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Bruces except that of the greatest Bruce of
all. King Robert's figure, it is believed, was
on the west end that has long been lost.
There is some fine old glass in this church,
and a modern window of exceptional
beauty.</p>

<p class="b1">Guisborough is not a place to stay in;
but only six miles away is Saltburn with
all its hotels. The short drive thither is
pretty, and close to the wayside on the
right is Upleatham Church, the smallest
used for services in England, with a
miniature tower and a nave about fifteen
feet long. Saltburn is a rising watering-place,
and has probably a gay future before
it, for it has many charms for those who
like plenty of breezes and bathing-boxes.
It must have been a lovely spot when it
was quiet, for its deep green dell ends in a
fine cliff, below which the sea ripples over
a many-coloured foreshore. The Zetland
Hotel faces these things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">From Saltburn we may drive across to
Brotton, or may take the longer way by
Skelton, passing near the castle. This is
now a house dating obviously from the
eighteenth century; but I believe there are
among its offices some slight remains of the
castle of the Bruces&mdash;the castle that was,
long after their day, the scene of much
revelry on the part of its owner John Hall
and his familiars. Among these was
Laurence Sterne. "Its festive board," says
a Georgian writer, "was attended by many
of the literati of the age. Where genius
and talent were blended in so close union
we cannot but imagine that the feast of
reason and the flow of soul were happily
realised." According to authentic accounts
the feast and the flow&mdash;not of reason
nor of soul&mdash;made the place a perfect
pandemonium.</p>

<p>Beyond Brotton the fine outline of Boulby
Cliff rises before us, marred by the huge
ironworks that disfigure so many places in
Cleveland. Loftus and Easington are uninteresting;
but a couple of miles after
passing through the latter we dip into
a lovely little tree-clad valley&mdash;one of
the many green gorges that run down,
"between the heather and the northern sea,"
with tumbling becks hurrying through them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
We climb out of this one on a stiff gradient,
and in another moment are looking down
on Staithes.</p>

<p class="b1">At the top of the hill that leads down
into Staithes there is a little railway inn.
Here it is advisable to leave the car, for
the hill is exceedingly steep, and there is
no place in the tiny fishing town itself
where a car may find shelter. Visitors, in
fact, are not encouraged. If, seeking food,
you ring at a door that seems to offer hope,
you are recommended to try elsewhere.
Yet the day will surely come when a large
hotel will rise upon the hill, and lodging-houses
will grow up round it, and we shall
hear of the "upper" and "lower" towns,
the new town and the old, and Staithes
will be spoilt. Meantime a cup of tea may
be had at the railway inn, which, though
homely, is extremely clean.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Long ago James Cook, a little shop-boy
hungry for the sea, ran away from Staithes.
One marvels that any one could steel his
heart to leave it. But to little James,
hitherto occupied in the scaring of crows,
Mr. Sanderson's shop under the hill was
merely the gate of a wonderful new world,
and he hardly hesitated before passing
through it to his adventurous life and
death; to the heights of Montcalm and the
depths of hitherto unsounded waters, and
finally to the knives of the South Seas.
Even here, it is plain, he was dreaming of
the South Seas. Some sailor brought a
South Sea shilling to Staithes and Cook,
seeing it in his master's till, was seized by
the romance of it and changed it for a
more prosaic coin. The transaction was
suspicious in the eyes of Sanderson, and
though he was sorry for his mistake when
he understood it, James indignantly left
him.</p>

<p class="b1">Staithes is dear to every artist who has
ever looked upon its streets and quays, and
indeed to every one who has an eye for
pictorial effect. The deep valley that we
crossed a few minutes ago ends here at the
sea in two cliffs, and between them the
town is wedged. The narrow paved street
winds down to the shore, where little quays
are washed by the waves, and little cottages
cling to the cliff for shelter, and boats are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
drawn up on the beach. At the river's
mouth, under the other cliff, hosts of
seagulls whirl about the rocks or float
upon the water; but most deplorably the
picturesque wooden bridge that has figured
in so many works of art is now replaced
by an unsightly iron girder. Staithes is a
place apart. In this deep gully, hidden from
land and sea, one seems to be worlds away
from ordinary English life. Even the
people are picturesque; the women and
little girls in pink or lilac sunbonnets and
gay aprons, and the men and boys in dark
blue knitted jerseys. Every group of
children, every ancient mariner, every
pretty girl in a doorway, is as decorative as
a peasant in the chorus of an operetta.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">RUNSWICK BAY.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">This coast is indented with bays. Runswick,
only a few miles away, may be seen
by making a short digression from Hinderwell&mdash;more
correctly Hilda's Well&mdash;where
there is a holy well named in honour of the
saintly abbess of Whitby. Runswick Bay is
sheltered on every side by hills. A long low
headland sweeps round it on the south, with
a strip of sandy beach following the line of
the land, and beyond the sand a curving
line of surf. On the nearer side a cliff protects
a cluster of red-tiled houses, and on
the summit of this cliff the car must be left
while we walk down the winding path. It
is only from below that the pretty grouping
of the village can be seen. In the tourist
season this bay is rather thickly populated,
and as the place cannot accommodate more
than a few of its admirers, the fields near
the shore are dotted with the tents of the
resolute. But there must be times when
this lovely haven is a haven of peace.</p>

<p>It is from the hill above Lythe that we
first see the Whitby cliff in the distance,
with the abbey standing up against the sky.
The coast and its long line of surf are
before us, and on the right are the trees
of Mulgrave Park. The present castle of
Mulgrave is modern, but there are still some
ruins to be seen of the old fortress of the
Saxon giant, Wada, and of the Norman
Fossards and mediæval Mauleys, and of the
seventeenth-century President of the North,
Lord Sheffield. It was one of the seven
Peters of the house of de Malo-Lacu, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Mauley, who beautified the castle so greatly
to his own satisfaction that he called it
Moult Grace. "But because it became a
grievance to the neighbours thereabouts,
the people (who have always the right of
coining words), by changing one single
letter, called it Moult Grave, by which
name it is everywhere known." Both its
grace and its seriousness were wiped away
by the time the Civil War was done.</p>

<p class="b1">The hill that leads from Lythe to the
coast is nearly a mile long, and has gradients
varying from 1 in 7 to 1 in 12.
At the foot of it is Sandsend, as near to
the sea as a place can stand. Here are
the mouths of two little green valleys, each
with its own little beck and each with
its own little village. The villages, the old
and the new, Sandsend and New Row, are
very tiny indeed, but there is a good hotel
between them, within reach of the salt
spray, and houses are being busily built.
The place is about to be fashionable, I
think, and indeed it has charms, with the
deep, green sides of the gorge at the back
of it, and the sea foaming at its doors.
For the greater part of our way from
Sandsend to Whitby we are on a private
road, with a toll of one shilling. There are
several sharp curves upon it, with "Special
Caution" notices, and the sides of the gully
at Upgang are very steep.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Whitby, fifty or a hundred years ago,
before the raucous cries of steam merry-go-rounds
disturbed the ghost of Cædmon or
grinning Aunt Sallies stood beside the
Abbey Cross, must have been the loveliest
town in England. Even now it is bewitching.
The old town and the new are separated
by the long harbour, with its crowd of
gaily painted cobles, its quays, its rows of
nets hung out to dry; and so, from the
windows of the Royal Hotel on the one
cliff, one can look across the water at the
other cliff, and the old houses closely packed
upon the slope, the red-tiled roofs, the high-pitched
gables, the queer passages; and
raised high above these the grassy hilltop,
the long, low church, the sloping graveyard
where Mary Linskill lies, the tall grey
cross of Cædmon. Crowning all stands the
ruined abbey on its height. A long flight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of steps winds up the steep hillside from
the harbour to the abbey, skirting the
churchyard; and from this distance, in the
dusk of evening, the stream of dark figures
climbing endlessly might well be blackrobed
pilgrims.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The tall gables of Whitby Abbey on its
bare and desolate cliff are known to us in
countless pictures. We are prepared for the
general effect of wild stateliness, the turrets
against the sky, the wind-swept height, the
whirling seabirds; but the beauty of the
architecture is a surprise to some of us&mdash;the
slender lancets, the rich triforium and
trefoiled arches, the rose window, and all
the wealth of ornament. The ruins of the
tower lie where they fell, a mass of <i>débris</i>
overgrown with grass and weeds. Here
under the grey-brown walls, which are
crumbled and bitten by the salt wind like
a cliff against which the spray has dashed
for centuries, we may sit and remember
the saints and kings who came to this
place when our history was young. It is
not of the actual builders of these arches
that we chiefly think. Hundreds of years
before their day a monastery stood here,
whose fame has always overshadowed this
later one. This is the story of it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1">In the seventh century King Oswy of
Northumbria and King Penda of the
Mercians were at war. In vain Oswy
offered conciliatory gifts: Penda would have
none of them. "If that pagan," cried the
exasperated Oswy, "refuses to receive our
gifts we will offer them to the Lord, who
knows how to accept them!" So he vowed,
if he defeated the "wicked king," to dedicate
his baby daughter to the cloister and
give sites for twelve monasteries. This
bleak cliff, then called Streaneshalch, the
Bay of the Lighthouse, was one of the sites
he gave when he had killed Penda, "that
destroyer of his neighbours and fomenter of
hostility," as William of Malmesbury calls
him; and on it a monastery was built by
the royal and saintly Abbess Hilda, "whom
all that knew her called Mother, for her
singular piety and grace." Here she ruled
for many years, teaching peace and charity,
training holy men&mdash;St. Wilfrid of Ripon,
St. John of Beverley&mdash;and even conquering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
snakes and birds, it was said. Important
things took place here during her rule. It
was here that the great synod was held
concerning the keeping of Easter, when St.
Wilfrid quoted St. Peter and Colman quoted
Columba till King Oswy closed the discussion
by saying, "Peter is an officer whom I am
not disposed to contradict ... lest when I
come to the doors of the kingdom of heaven
there may be no one to open them to me."
And it was here, somewhere within a stone's
throw of this actual spot, that Cædmon,
the lay-brother, the herdsman "who did
not learn the art of poetry from man but
from God," stood before St. Hilda in the
presence of learned men, and told his vision
and recited the verses that were the first
English poem. "And his song and his
verse were so winsome to hear, that his
teachers themselves wrote and learned from
his mouth." It was somewhere close at
hand, too, that this earliest of our poets
lay down to die in the infirmary, "conversing
pleasantly in a joyful manner." "I am
in charity, my children," he said, "with all
the servants of God." Then he crossed himself,
"laid his head on the pillow, and
falling into a slumber, ended his life so in
silence." St. Hilda herself, "whose life was
a bright example to all who desired to live
well," died and was buried here, but her
bones were afterwards taken to Glastonbury.
The dust of her successor, however&mdash;that
Princess Elfleda whom Oswy dedicated
to the religious life when he defeated
Penda&mdash;lies somewhere very near this spot,
within the abbey church itself, with that
of the king her father, and her mother,
Queen Eanfled. And down there on the
slope, where the old cross stands, was the
graveyard of the monks and in it the grave
of Cædmon.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">In the ninth century came the sons of
Lothbroc the Dane, Hinguar and Hubba,
"men of terrible obstinacy and unheard-of
valour." Flying the invincible standard
which their sisters had made with their
own hands, they landed on this coast and
utterly destroyed the monastery of Streaneshalch.</p>

<p>For two hundred years this spot lay
desolate. Then Reinfrid the soldier saw it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and was "pricked to the heart." He became
a monk of Evesham, and after long years
came back to Streaneshalch&mdash;by that time
also called "Hwiteby"&mdash;to carry on the
traditions of the past. He began the work
of raising the new abbey on the site of the
old; but it was those who came after him
who built that early English chancel, and
carved the lilies of the north transept, and
made the decorated window through which
we see the church, and the bluff headlands,
and the white teeth of the North Sea for
ever biting at the cliff.</p>

<p class="b1">There is no need to return to the town, for
we can join the high-road to Scarborough
at a point not far from here. By going a
few miles out of the direct route we may
see another of the sheltered bays that
make this coast so beautiful; the bay where
long ago, it is said, a fleet of fishing-boats
was always ready to carry Robin Hood
and his merry men to safety. Robin
Hood's Butts, on the further side of the
bay, are supposed to have been used as
targets for his bowmen by that "most kind
and obliging robber," as a sixteenth-century
writer calls him. A long, steep hill leads
down into the little town, which lies on
the northern side of the crescent bay; the
old town with its red houses clustered in
the shelter of the cliff, its walls washed by
the spray; the new town higher up the
slope. There, below us, is the quay where
John Wesley so often preached. It was
there that he received&mdash;not without seeing
the humour of it&mdash;the sailor's remonstrance
against the theory that the fear of
death could only be overcome by the fear
of God. The sailor evidently felt that his
reputation was at stake.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">This lower and most romantic part of
Bay Town is far the most attractive, but
even the upper town is not unpleasing,
though it has several little hotels, and
threatens to develop into a watering-place.
There is a road that leads out of
the valley on the further side, but it is
extremely bad in every way, and it is
practically imperative to return as we came.</p>

<p class="b1">Soon after regaining the high-road we
climb slowly up to the moors. Looking
back we can still see the cleft in the hills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
where Whitby's red houses are hidden, and
the headlands beyond it, and the stately
abbey on the cliff. Before us there is a run
so entrancing, a feast of colour so deeply
satisfying, that these moors of Cleveland
must henceforward, I think, be the standard
by which we appraise all moorland runs.
The road lies visible in front of us for
miles: at times so straight that the telegraph
wires are foreshortened till the posts
are hardly distinguishable one from another;
at other times winding in serpentine curves
into the far distance. On each side of us,
from the wheels of the hurrying car to the
horizon, stretches the heather. Here and
there is a patch of bracken, now and then
a strip of yellow grass; but it is heather
that makes the landscape, that flings its
imperial robes over the hills and nestles
under the wayside stones, that satisfies the
eye and rests the heart with its astonishing
beauty. Miles of road fly under us; we
glide up and we dart down; now we dip
into a ferny dell and climb out of it again,
now we cross a stony beck, now we pass
a plantation of firs; but still the setting
is heather, deep bell-heather and pale ling,
purple and crimson and mauve, sweeping
away till the colours are merged in blue.
Bluest of all is the sea, which appears now
and then in a triangle of sapphire at the
end of a glen. On the shores of that blue
sea, a couple of miles to our left, is Ravenscar,
which takes its name from the raven
standard of the sons of Danish Lothbroc,
who landed here when they came to devastate
St. Hilda's abbey. Such at least
is the tradition.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Gradually, and most reluctantly, we leave
these shining heights for the lower world.
The heather gives way to fields; the road
is again bounded by respectable stone walls.
We pass Claughton, then run down a steep
hill between trees. Beyond these fir-trees,
which rise up like walls on each side of the
road, Scarborough appears&mdash;a dim mass of
red blurred with smoke&mdash;and its castle
lifted high above it on the headland.</p>

<p class="b1">"The toune stondith hole on a slaty clife,"
says Leland, "and shoith very fair to the
se side." How very fair this place must
have been one can easily imagine, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
there was nothing here but the picturesque
town of a Tudor day, and the "exceding
goodly larg and strong castelle on a stepe
rok," and the "paroche chirch of our Lady
joyning almost to the castelle," and the
"3 howsis of freres, grey, blake, and white,"
and the sea-wall made by Richard III.,
"now yn ruine by the se rage," and the
"peere whereby socour is made for shippes,"
which, when Leland saw it, was "sore decayid."
The town was partly walled then,
too, and had two gates, one "meatley good,"
and one "very base." Only one or two of
all these things are left, and even they are
now as sore decayed as was the pier of
Henry VIII.'s time. Yet Scarborough is
still exceeding fair; so fair that it overcomes
all one's prejudices against popular
watering-places; fair even in spite of huge
hotels and a beach black with people, and
rows of ice-cream stalls, and braying bands,
and hoarse hurdy-gurdies, and all kinds of
music. It is built at the junction of two
bays, between which the castle juts out
on "a rock of wonderful height and
bigness, inaccessible by reason of steep
craggs almost on every side." Into both of
these bays the North Sea sweeps, even
upon the calmest day, in mighty curves of
frothing surf. Below the castle is a little
sheltered harbour, where a crowd of fishing-boats
and smacks is protected from the
"se rage" by breakwaters. Quite lately
a wide road with an embankment has been
built from bay to bay round the base of
the castle promontory. Those who have
loved the rough rocks that once were here
feel naturally that this new drive spoils
the beauty of the place. But, after all,
Scarborough is not designed for lovers of
wild nature. The mischief was done here
long ago. The new drive is a boon to
thousands who have to take their pleasure
in bath-chairs, and in this place of esplanades
and lawn-tennis court and smart clothes a
little more artificiality is no great grievance.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">From very early days this rock has been
fortified. In the Heimskringla, I believe,
those who can may read how Harald the
Norseman landed near the strong fortress
of Skardaburg, and how he and his men
climbed the hill behind the town and made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
a mighty bonfire; then, with pitchforks,
flung the burning faggots down among the
wooden houses. "There the Northmen
killed many people." The present castle
was originally built by William le Gros,
one of the heroes of the Battle of the
Standard, who "increased the natural
strength of the place by a very costly
work." Henry III. in his fear of his barons
ordered it to be destroyed, and when its
owner demurred came to destroy it himself.
When he saw the costly work, however,
he bethought him of another destiny for
it. He made it a little stronger and kept
it himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Scarborough Castle has never yielded
except to guile or famine. When Piers
Gaveston, the silly favourite of a silly king,
took refuge here from the barons who
were tired of his wit and his insulting
nicknames, it was famine that made him
surrender himself and his ill-gotten goods&mdash;crown
jewels and all&mdash;to Warwick, "the
Black Dog," and Pembroke, "the Jew."
The great Douglas, by the English named
the "Black" and by the Scots the "Good,"
the guardian of the Bruce's heart and the
hero of seventy fights, attacked Scarborough
Castle in vain; and more than two hundred
years later Robert Aske and his Pilgrims
of Grace, though they took the town,
failed to make any impression whatever
upon the fortress. There was a certain
market-day in Mary's reign, however, when
a party of peasants strolled up this castle
hill, and without any ado were allowed to
pass with their wares between those round
towers which we still may see, and over the
two draw-bridges, and past the keep into
the castle bailey. Perhaps the sentinels were
a little surprised at the number of peasants
who came to sell butter and eggs that day,
but they were certainly more surprised
when they saw their castle in the hands
of Thomas Stafford and the rest of the
smocked rebels. The masquerade cost
Stafford his life, and did his cause no
good at all.</p>

<p>Twice again was Scarborough Castle
attacked, both times in the Civil War, both
times by the army of the Parliament. It
was during the first of these sieges that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the church&mdash;the "paroche chirch joyning
almost to the castelle"&mdash;lost its chancel.
There are still gaunt fragments of it
standing like pillars in the churchyard, as
we may see. The choir was turned into
a battery, but received more hurt than it
gave before the castle yielded at last to
starvation so terrible that some of the
garrison were carried out in sheets. Then
a Parliament-man was put in as governor,
but as he shortly afterwards declared for
the king the siege began again. The
Parliament took no more risks. When
they had retaken it, and dealt with it as
their manner was, Scarborough Castle was
no longer very redoubtable.</p>

<p>Its state of disrepair was a cause of
much discomfort to poor George Fox a
few years later; for this dilapidated building
was one of his many prisons, and he found
it far from weather-proof. The home-made
suit of leather that impressed Carlyle so
much&mdash;"the one continuous including case"&mdash;must
have been worn out by this time,
I think, for the wetness of his clothes was
one of the great Quaker's most constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
afflictions. When the smoky chimney
prompted him to tax the Roman Catholic
governor with sending him to Purgatory
he was put into a room that had no fireplace
at all. "Being to the sea-side," he
says of it, "and lying much open, the
wind drove in the rain forcibly, so that the
water came over my bed and ran about
the room, that I was fain to skim it up
with a platter." Here he received distinguished
visitors, and argued about the
Pope's infallibility with as much spirit
as ever.</p>

<p>The maimed church that stands below
the castle on the slope is not now so imposing
as once it was, but it is still a fine
building and has four chantries. In its
shadow lies Anne Brontë. From the road
leading to the castle gate, at a point near
the fountain, one may see by looking over
the wall of the churchyard the upright
stone that bears her name. When she
was dying, her sister Charlotte, with the
desperate hope of those who despair,
brought her to Scarborough, whose bay
and headlands gave her the last pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
she had. "It made her happy," wrote
Charlotte, "to see Scarborough and its
bay once more.... Our lodgings are
pleasant, as Anne sits at the window she
can look down on the sea."</p>

<p class="pn p2">It is hard to turn away from the sea so
soon. If we find it too hard to bear we
may stay at Scarborough for a couple of
nights, and, taking a short run down the
coast, may see Filey, and the white cliffs
of Flamborough, and the beautiful priory
church of Bridlington, in a few hours.
Then we can turn westwards with less
discontent, especially if we make a short
<i>détour</i> by Scalby, Hackness, and the Forge
Valley.</p>

<p>Hackness lies in a nest of trees. Every
road that leads to it is lovely. As we run
down through glades and woods to this
sheltered, still retreat, this green bower of
sweeping boughs, it is easy to understand
how deeply restful it must have seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
St. Hilda of Whitby and to the monks of
a later day. Hilda founded the tiny community
here, and made it a cell of her own
great abbey, hoping, perhaps, to come here
herself sometimes when she was tired of
living in the teeth of the wind. The little
grey church, wrapped and hidden in the
trees, is partly Norman, partly Early English,
but has various relics in it belonging to the
Saxon life of Hilda's nunnery: a broken
cross or pillar inscribed with runes, and a
Saxon stone built into a Norman arch. A
tablet on the wall tells how "the Lady
Hilda of royal descent did for the sake of
security and retirement establish a nunnery
or cell for 8 nuns at Hackness." The fortunes
of the place rose and fell with those
of its parent abbey, for when Whitby was
destroyed by the Danes in the ninth century,
Hackness, too, was utterly wiped out. Then
came the Norman revival. But "thieves
and robbers coming out of the forests and
dens where they lurked, carried away all
the monks' substance, and laid that holy
place&mdash;Whitby Abbey&mdash;desolate. In like
manner pirates, void of all compassion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
landing there, came and plundered the monastery."
So the monks' benefactor, William
de Percy, gave them this retreat, already
sacred to the memory of their great predecessor,
where, like her, they might find
security and retirement. Even to-day those
priceless boons are to be found at Hackness.
Even on an August afternoon, when the
Forge Valley may almost be described as
crowded, there are security and retirement
in the green nest at Hackness.</p>

<p>Two miles of moderately pretty country
lie between these two places. We see the
thick woods before us like a wall across
the landscape, and the archway of trees
that spans the road is the gate into the
Forge Valley. This little glen is too famous
for its own good; but not a word of its
fame is undeserved. In the early morning
it must be quite perfect in its own gentle
way, with its little river winding under
the trees beside the road, and the grassy
banks, and the cool woods rising on each
side, and the paths that leave the wayside
and disappear alluringly into the shadows.
But in the afternoon of a summer's day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
when the grass is strewn with bowler hats,
and every birch-tree is the background of
a family group, flight is best. The flight is
quite a short one, for the valley is on a
miniature scale.</p>

<p>At its mouth, in a field beside the Derwent,
is the ruin that was once Ayton
Castle, a shattered tower that seems to
have had many owners in turn, Attons
and St. Johns and Euers and Cliffords, and
was no doubt very useful in defending the
narrow defile through which we have just
driven. It came to the Cliffords with Margaret
Bromflete, who was descended from
one of the Attons, and was the wife of
Clifford the Butcher. This was the Lady
Clifford who saved her son's life by sending
him away into hiding when the cause of
the Red Rose seemed altogether lost: so
this fragment of masonry is probably one
of the many castles that were restored to
the Shepherd Lord when Henry VII. became
king. It is a place after the Shepherd's
own heart, for in his day no doubt the
valley of the Forge was as peaceful as
Hackness. Indeed, only a hundred years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
ago, a writer described the neighbourhood
of Ayton as "grotesquely rural."</p>

<p>The beauty of the scenery ends rather
suddenly as we drive through the two
Aytons, East and West, and go on our way
to Pickering. However, the road is level
and has an excellent surface, and if the
landscape is a little dull the villages are
pretty. We pass through a series of them,
all more or less alike and all built mainly
of grey stone, for we are near the moors.
On the outskirts of Brompton is Gallows
Hill, whence, from her brother's farm, "the
phantom of delight," Mary Hutchinson, came
out one autumn morning to marry Wordsworth
in the church whose spire rises on
our left. With the bridegroom was Dorothy,
a little sad-hearted we may guess; and with
the "perfect woman" was her sister Joanna,
that "wild-hearted" girl who found her
brother-in-law's "dear friendships with the
streams and groves" so comical that her
laughter on the subject once raised echoes
from all the hills of Grasmere. The church
in which this wedding took place is interesting
for its own sake, and contains, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
have read, a memorial to a sixteenth-century
soldier, "who in wars to his greit charges
sarved oin kyng and tow quenes with du
obediens and died without recumpens." I
did not see this, but quote it for the sake
of those who collect curious epitaphs.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Beyond Brompton the road skirts Ebberston
and Allerston, and passes through
Thornton-le-Dale, where a stream of some
size runs by the wayside from end to end
of the village, and an old cross stands
among flowers. This village has a name
for beauty, and like some other beauties
takes a little too much pains to keep that
reputation. It is certainly a pretty village,
but it has rather a self-conscious air.
Pickering is about two miles away.</p>

<p>Pickering is not particularly beautiful,
but its ruined castle, and above all its
wonderful church, should certainly be seen,
for one rarely finds a church whose relics
represent so many dates. The font is
Saxon, the pulpit Chippendale, and between
these two extremes of craftsmanship&mdash;the
roughly hewn stone and the delicately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
chiselled wood&mdash;are the fourteenth-century
tombs and the fifteenth-century frescoes,
and the Elizabethan chest. When Leland
was here he saw and noted this figure of
Sir William Bruce, and the "cantuarie
bering his name," and that other effigy, of
alabaster, with the "garland about his
helmet," which represents Sir David Roucliffe
and no Bruce, though Leland calls him
one. Of these strange frescoes above our
heads, which make the special fame of
Pickering Church, there is no word in
Leland's record. Possibly these pictured
saints and virtues&mdash;St. Christopher and St.
George and the Corporal Acts of Mercy&mdash;were
so often to be seen in churches of
his day that they did not call for comment,
or it may be that they were already hidden
under the thick coat of plaster that covered
them for hundreds of years. They were
discovered in the middle of the nineteenth
century, and promptly whitewashed without
fear or favour. The most elaborate of the
pictures is the Feast of Herod, which shows
that king dressed in mediæval garments
suggestive of Mrs. Markham's History, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
John the Baptist is being horribly beheaded
in the corner.</p>

<p>The remains of the castle are above the
town; but the names of Rosamund's tower
and the Devil's are more romantic than
their appearance, and the inevitable lawn-tennis
court can be more easily forgiven
here than in the baileys of more beautiful
ruins. This castle belonged to the house of
Lancaster, and therefore in his day to that
Lancaster, "the Actor," whom Piers Gavestone
in his last moments besought for
mercy, the Lancaster who so shortly afterwards
was crying "Have mercy on me,
King of Heaven!" when his turn came to
be beheaded. It belonged, too, to the
"time-honoured Lancaster" whose son imprisoned
Richard II. for a little while within
these very walls. All the prisons, it seems,
to which Henry IV. committed Richard&mdash;Knaresborough,
Pickering, Pontefract&mdash;were
his own Lancastrian castles, and at Henry's
accession, of course, became crown property.
This one, which held for the King in the
Civil War, still belongs to the Duchy of
Lancaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Not many miles from Pickering, at the
very brink of the moors, is a village whose
name is familiar to lovers of old buildings
and students of church history, and whose
charms of seclusion and quietness are so
endearing that even the unlearned are likely
to think of it again and again with affection.
I do not think "excursions" ever go to
Lastingham. There is nothing there to attract
those who visit a sacred ruin to play
games in its aisles, or to sit on the high
altar till it becomes necessary to enclose it
with a railing, or to photograph their <i>fiancées</i>
under its arches. These are only drawn by
a famous name. The fame of Lastingham
is hidden in a few ancient books, and in
the works of archæologists, and in the
memories of those who have sought peace
and found it there. To reach it we must
turn to the right a couple of miles beyond
Pickering, and drive by winding ways and
on rather an indifferent surface to the foot
of the moors.</p>

<p>It is at Cropton that the moors first
come into sight. The scenery has been uninteresting
since we left the Forge Valley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and it is with all the more delight that
we suddenly, at a turn of the road, find
the landscape filled with colour and warmth
and beauty, with hills green in the foreground
and gloriously crimson against the
sky. The road curves and twists and curves
again, as though hunting for Lastingham
among the little valleys. It seems to be altogether
lost, and then suddenly we find it.</p>

<p class="b1">About twelve hundred and fifty years ago,
when its history began, it was not so easily
found. Ethelwald, king of the Deiri, wished
to have a monastery in his own Northumbrian
country&mdash;some peaceful spot to which,
when he had a mind, he might retire for
prayer and quietness during his life, and in
which he might be buried when he died.
So he summoned to him that "holy, wise,
and good man," Cedd, Bishop of the East
Angles and brother of St. Chad, and offered
him a piece of land. Cedd "chose himself
a place among craggy and distant mountains
which looked like lurking-places for
robbers ... to the end that the fruits of
good works should spring up where before
beasts were wont to dwell, or men to live
after the manner of beasts." Such is Bede's
rather overdrawn description of this green
hollow among the rounded hills; yet some
say that Bede visited the place himself.
Having chosen the spot it was necessary
"to cleanse the place for the monastery
from former crimes," so Cedd and his brother
Cynebil kept between them a forty days'
fast upon that little knoll where the church
stands, uplifted above the village. There the
monastery rose, and thither the bishop often
came to see that all was well. Once he
came at a time "when there was a mortality
there," and, catching the epidemic, he died.
And so it happens that the dust of this
Saxon saint lies beneath the crypt of Lastingham
Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Cedd's brother, the famous Chad, to whom
so many churches are dedicated, succeeded
him as abbot, and was often here. In connection
with him Bede tells a poetical story
of a monk of Lastingham. Oswini was a
practical man, and felt himself unfitted for
the contemplative life, yet greatly longed to
renounce the world. So "quitting all he
had"&mdash;he had been a Queen's Prime Minister&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
came to St. Chad here on this little
hill, and, pointing to the hatchet and axe
that he had brought in his hand, put himself
and them at the service of the monks.
So while the others prayed Brother Oswini
worked. And it was he, the humble worker
with his hands, and not the monks upon
their knees in the church, who heard the
voices of the heavenly choir. He was "doing
such things as were necessary" in the house
when, "on a sudden," as he afterwards said,
"he heard the voice of persons singing most
sweetly and rejoicing, and appearing to descend
from heaven." This sound of singing
surged round the oratory where Chad was
at prayer, then returned to heaven, "the
way it came, with inexpressible sweetness."
None heard it but the saint and the man
of labour. Chad knew the meaning of it.
"They were angelic spirits," he said, "who
came to call me to my heavenly reward,
which I have always longed after." Seven
days later, says the historian, the bishop
died.</p>

<p>This gate and path will lead us to the
knoll where all these things happened, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the actual death of Chad. Here Brother
Oswini worked and heard the angels sing:
here Cedd fasted and died. Here in this
little crypt, which we reach through the
strange walled opening in the nave, his
dust lies on the right of the altar. Some
say that these Saxon stones with the fishes
and dragons carved upon them have been
here ever since the days of Cedd; but
the sturdy piers and vaulted ceiling of the
miniature chapel are, of course, Norman.
They, and the apse above them, were probably
the work of those monks of Whitby
who founded the Abbey of St. Mary at
York, and seem to have paused here for
ten years on their way thither.</p>

<p>The street by which we entered Lastingham
winds down the slope to the foot of
the hollow; on the right of it is the restored
Well of St. Cedd in its stone basin.
The heather of the huge Cleveland moors is
hardly more than a stone's-throw distant;
and high upon the hill that overlooks the
site of the Saxon monastery is a cross, not
ancient, but very striking in this place. The
tiny inn is close under the church. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
extremely small, and of the homeliest kind;
but I think that any one who is not daunted
by the simple life&mdash;the <i>very</i> simple life, be
it plainly understood&mdash;will carry away pleasant
memories of the quietness and cleanliness
and kindliness within its doors. It has,
unfortunately, not even a shed wherein to
shelter a car, but only a grass plot where a
car may spend a fine night.</p>

<p class="b1">We climb out of Lastingham by a road
that passes close to the cross. This cross
was set up in commemoration of Queen
Victoria's accession, but there must surely
have been another thought in the minds of
those who placed it so symbolically in this
particular spot. Let us pause for a moment
and look down. The village lies below us
in its little hollow, with the church of the
early saints raised in its midst; and just
above us, conspicuous on its height and
clearly outlined against the sky, stands the
cross. It seems to guard the boundary
between the poetry of Lastingham and the
prose of the ordinary world, for the beauty
that makes such a perfect setting for the
place ends suddenly on the brow of the
hill, and we speed away among commonplace
fields and hedges to join the high-road by
way of Appleton-le-Moor.</p>

<p class="p1">At Keldholme, though the priory is marked
on the map as though still in existence, only
some stones built into a wall are left to
show where de Stutteville's nunnery stood.
As for the de Stutteville's own castle, which
once rose proudly on the hill to our right,
the stones of it form the walls of the neighbouring
prison, and the site of it is a
pasturage for the neighbouring cows.</p>

<p>The prison in question&mdash;a dark, repellent
spot in a pretty street&mdash;is in the market-place
of Kirbymoorside. Nearly facing it
is the "Black Swan," whose pretty red-tiled
porch bears the date 1632; but it was the
"King's Head," further up the street, to
which Pope alluded when he said, neither
truthfully nor politely, that the second Duke
of Buckingham died at Kirbymoorside "in
the worst inn's worst room." This trim,
modern-looking house with the sober front
of grey, so unsuggestive of the rakish duke,
has never formed a part of the inn, and
it was in its best room that Buckingham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
on his deathbed, declared he had always
had the greatest veneration for religion and
reason. We may not cross the threshold of
the room into which the dying man was
carried&mdash;and, indeed, even penitent upon his
deathbed, George Villiers the second was
hardly an object for pilgrimages!&mdash;but here
is its little window overlooking the street,
the middle window of the three that
are next the inn. Many writers, following
Macaulay and Pope, assume that Buckingham
died in this house because he had
squandered his fortune so thoroughly that
he could not secure a more comfortable
place to die in. But some tell a more likely,
if less edifying, tale. The duke was injured
or taken ill, they say, while hunting near
this town, and as his own castle of Helmsley
was several miles away he was carried hither,
to the house of one of his tenants. It seems
certain that the estate of Helmsley was still
his at his death, since his executors received
nearly ninety thousand pounds for it from
Charles Duncombe, banker and goldsmith. A
man who had once possessed all that the
Buckinghams had taken from their kings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
might be said to have squandered his fortune
without being actually in want of a
roof to die under. He had at one time a
very fine roof of his own here at Kirbymoorside,
but this may have been one of
the many things he had lost, or possibly the
Civil War had left it in a state even less
luxurious than this little grey house. By
following a stony lane we may see, in a
farmyard above the town, the few fragments
of masonry that are the last remains of the
castle of the Nevilles and the Buckinghams.
Queen Elizabeth took it from the Nevilles,
and her successor gave it to the man of
whom he said: "You may be sure that I
love the Earl of Buckingham more than
any one else."</p>

<p>The second duke, who died so humbly, was
buried with his betters&mdash;among whom, I
think, we may include his father&mdash;in Westminster
Abbey. His body was embalmed,
and the oft-quoted line in the register of
burials at Kirbymoorside refers only to the
viscera: "1687 April 17th. Gorges vilaus Lord
dooke of bookingam."</p>

<p>About a mile beyond Kirbymoorside there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
is a little valley, not far from the high-road,
of which perhaps the greater number of us
have never heard. The appeal of Kirkdale,
like that of Lastingham, is not to the many,
and for that very reason it is irresistible to
some; not only to the man of science and the
historian, but to all those who can best hear
the voices of the dead in places where there
are no voices of the living. There is silence
in Kirkdale.</p>

<p class="b1">A steep hill with a preposterous surface
leads down to Hodge Beck; to the wooden
footbridge among the trees, and the quarry
where the hyænas used to live, and the splash
that we must cross. Those limestone rocks
to the right are famous in the world of
science, for that dark cave whose entrance
we may see was discovered, about a hundred
years ago, to be strewn with the bones of
strange beasts. It was a veritable treasury
for geologists, for the hyænas who lived and
died here in such quantities not only
bequeathed their own bones to us, but also
many bones of the uncouth creatures they
were in the habit of eating, creatures most
happily no longer with us. There were once
tigers and elephants, it appears, in quiet
Kirkdale.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">We climb out of the beck and turn to the
right. The narrow glen is thickly wooded,
after the manner of Yorkshire dales both
large and small, and in a clump of firs stands
the Minster of St. Gregory. This is a fine
name for so small a building; but it was
called a minster nearly nine hundred years
ago, and we need not deny it the distinction
in its venerable age. It is not for its beauty
that we come to see it, though it is picturesque
enough in its setting of trees; but chiefly it is
for the sake of one stone in its wall, and of
the names inscribed upon it&mdash;names familiar
yet remote, the names of Edward the King
and Tosti the Earl. Here they are, carved in
the lifetime of those who bore them. It is
plain that this great stone was not always,
as it is now, under a porch; for it was once
a sundial, and here it is always in the
shadow. The words upon it are deeply and
clearly graven, easily distinguished, and,
except for a few words, easily understood.
This is the whole inscription, carved in two
columns, with one line below the dial:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">"Orm Gamal Suna Bohte STS Gregorius Minster Wonne
Hit Wes AEl Tobrocan &amp; Tofalan &amp; He Hit Let Macan
Newan From Grunde XPE &amp; STS Gregorius In Eadward
Dagum CNG &amp; In Tosti Dagum Eorl, &amp; Hawarth Me
Wrohte &amp; Brand, PRS."</p>

<p>(<i>Orm Gamal's son, bought St. Gregory's Minster when it
was all tobroken and tofallen, and he it let be made new
from ground to Christ and St. Gregory, in Edward's days,
the King, and in Tosti's days, the Earl, &amp; Howarth me
wrought, and Brand, Priests.</i>)</p>

<p class="p1 b1">The sundial has its own legend:&mdash;</p>


<p class="ppn20">"This is Daeges Solmerca Aet Ilcum Tide.'<br />
(<i>This is Day's sunmarker at every time.</i>")</p>

<p class="p1">This church, then, was made new from the
ground in the middle of the eleventh century;
for it was in 1056 that Tosti, the son of the
famous Godwin, obtained the earldom of
Northumbria; and it was in 1065 that he
"impelled the Northumbrians to rebel, by
the asperity of his manners," and so lost his
earldom. In using these words William of
Malmesbury is really most moderate, for
Tosti seems to have been a terrible swashbuckler.
He murdered, among many others,
the son of the very man who rebuilt this
church and set up this inscription: "All the
sons of the traitor Godwin," says an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
chronicler, "were men of such wickedness
that if they saw any beautiful town belonging
to any one they caused the lord of it to be
slain by night, and his offspring to be
destroyed, that they might obtain his
property." On one occasion Tosti seized his
brother Harold by the hair in the king's
presence, while he was actually drinking his
Majesty's health; whereupon Harold lifted
Tosti "up on high, and dashed him down
on the floor." Such was the asperity of their
manners.</p>

<p>Edward the King is, of course, the Confessor,
the "harmless king."</p>

<p>Within the church there are two carved
stones round which much discussion circles.
Until lately they were in the outer wall,
where they naturally suffered much from
the climate. One of them&mdash;the one that has
a cross engraved upon it&mdash;once bore the words
"Cyning Æthilwald," or "King Ethelwald," in
runic letters. Upon the slender foundation
of this somewhat vague inscription it has
been argued that this is the coffin lid of King
Ethelwald: therefore Ethelwald was buried
at Kirkdale: therefore Cedd's monastery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
where Ethelwald wished to be buried, was at
Kirkdale and not at Lastingham. This last
conclusion is then turned into a premise,
with a view to suggesting that the beautiful
stone with the Celtic design upon it may be
the coffin lid of Cedd himself. Yet Bede says
that Cedd was buried at "Lestingau."</p>

<p class="b1">The door of St. Gregory's Minster is locked.
We may see the "sunmarker" and its clear
lettering without entering the building, and
also a slab of stone with an interlaced Celtic
pattern which is let into the outer wall; but
to see the reputed coffin lids of Ethelwald and
Cedd&mdash;which are beautiful specimens of Celtic
work, whatever their story&mdash;we must drive to
Nawton village, a mile away, and fetch the
key from the Vicarage. This seems hard;
and if hard for motorists, a hundred times
harder for bicyclists and others. The Yorkshire
churches are in the main very kind to the
public. Many of them are left open, with a
suggestive money-box close to the door, and
often with a guide-book that may be
borrowed. By this method the church
probably gains rather than loses, since it
is pleasanter to give half a crown to an old
building that deserves it than to give sixpence
to an old man who has learnt a few facts
by rote, and learnt them wrongly. If it
is possible, however, to forgive a church for
being closed we must forgive this church of
Kirkdale. It has again and again been
defaced and desecrated by those curious folk
who love their own insignificant initials more
than any fairer sight. It is certain that those
who care so little for a building as to treat it
thus will not journey very far to fetch the
key.</p>

<p class="p1">The fine high-road that skirts the eastern
moors, the road on which we have been
travelling since we left Scarborough, comes
to an end, in a sense, at Helmsley; for here
it splits up into two roads, each of which we
must follow for a time. Helmsley itself has
its attractions. Among them are an open
market square and an ancient cross, pretty
houses and an inn covered with flowers, a
tiny stream running through the town from
end to end, and a castle-keep upon the hill.
This is that castle which was "once proud
Buckingham's delight," and now stands within
the park whose name is borrowed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Duncombe the banker. Helmsley has passed
through many hands, of which some helped
in the making of history, and some were not
over clean. The first name we hear of in
connection with the place is no less a one
than William the Conqueror, for he, having
given Helmsley to one of his followers, chose
it on one occasion for his own resting-place,
after a heavy march and much hard work
of the destructive kind he affected. His host,
Earl Morton, lost these lands in the losing
cause of Robert Curthose, and they fell to
the famous Walter of Espec, one of the
leaders in that strange semi-religious victory,
the Battle of the Standard, whose heroes
were summoned by an archbishop, absolved
upon the field by a bishop, and actually overshadowed
through the fight by the consecrated
Host and the banners of three saints. Just
such a mixture as this, of religion and bloodshed,
was Walter himself, with his splendid
presence, his gigantic height, his bright eyes
and noble forehead, his voice "like the sound
of a trumpet," his life as a warrior, and his
death as a monk. Walter's sister Adeline
married Peter de Ros, and it was their great-grandson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Robert de Ros, who built this much
dilapidated tower of Helmsley Castle. After
long centuries of ownership by unimportant
Williams and Roberts and Georges the place
came into the fair hands of Katherine, the
daughter of the Earl of Rutland, and the
wholly undeserved wife of the first Duke of
Buckingham. Lady Katherine Manners was
not, as is sometimes said, the granddaughter
of Sir Philip Sidney, for it was her Uncle
Roger, not her father, who married Sidney's
daughter. The Duchess of Buckingham inherited
all the wealth of her father's house,
for her two little half-brothers died "by
wicked practice and sorcery": so Helmsley
came to Steenie, whose angel-face brought
him so much beside his nickname. All his
honours and his riches were won, says
Clarendon, "upon no other advantage or
recommendation than of the beauty and
gracefulness and becomingness of his person."
Yet something more truly lovable than this,
we may be sure, was needed to win his Kate
and her broad lands; and indeed the romance
that gives this castle of Helmsley its chief
interest remained romantic to the end, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
though the duchess lived to write: "I pray
God never woman may love a man as I have
done you."</p>

<p class="b1">James I.'s slave-dog, as he called himself,
was too busy in court and camp to visit
Helmsley much, if ever, but it must have
been a fine sight when it was his. The keep,
not then a crumbling fragment, rose high
above walls and many towers. Here are
still the two moats that surrounded them,
and the two gateways that once made a
double defence. How strong the defences
were we may gather from the trouble they
gave to Sir Thomas Fairfax when he besieged
the castle in the time of the second Duke of
Buckingham, and won it at last, not only
for the Parliament, but for himself. His
grateful country gave him the lands of
Helmsley, but at the same time took the
precaution of reducing the castle to ruins,
so that this shattered keep and gatehouse
should never again defend royalist or rebel.
The Buckinghams were ever humorists, and
the second duke, pondering how he might
regain some of his lost possessions, bethought
him of marrying Mary Fairfax. After he
had been embroiled in many plots and
suffered many imprisonments he settled
down here within sight of the tower that
his father-in-law had reduced to so sad a
state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">There, beyond the lawn-tennis court, is
the house he lived in. Some of it seems to
be older than his day, but he probably was
obliged to repair it rather thoroughly after
the siege. We may climb those steps, if we
will, and enter.</p>

<p>These are haunted rooms. They are not
haunted by a very worthy ghost, I fear&mdash;not
even by Steenie of the dainty leg and
the lovely complexion, the gallant adventurer
whom many loved much and whom
we all love a little&mdash;but only by his handsome,
vicious son, the son who was born
to the sound of all the joy-bells of Westminster,
and died in the humble little bed
at Kirbymoorside. These rooms were once
proud Buckingham's delight; now they tear
at one's heart. It is a thing to be glad of,
no doubt, that Lord Mayor Duncombe found
Buckingham's home too small to hold his
vaulting ambitions and so built the palace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
in the park, leaving us this pitiful relic of
departed glory. Yet one marvels that any
man should have allowed so much beauty
to go to wrack. These great oak panels
with their rare design, this splendid moulded
ceiling wrought so elaborately with Tudor
roses, that frieze of shields and fleurs-de-lys,
of mermaids and winged dragons, once made
an appropriate setting for the man whom
a contemporary called the "finest gentleman
of person and wit" he ever saw. Now,
in their decayed grandeur, they are appropriate
still; a dramatic&mdash;almost a melodramatic&mdash;symbol
of his fate. Half the
panelling is gone; shred by shred the
plaster of the ceiling is falling on the uneven
floor; bare laths and gaping holes
disfigure the Tudor roses over our heads;
of the mermaids and winged dragons only
a few are left. Lumber is piled upon the
floor where "all mankind's epitome" was
wont to walk; cobwebs and dust deface the
windows. Such is the symbol of proud
Buckingham, than whom "no man was ever
handsomer," yet who was, in the last year
of his life, "worn to a thread"; and up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
there in the park is the symbol of the city
knight who bought his property with money
not always well-gained, and flourished like
a green bay-tree. We see the unromantic,
prosperous house of the thrifty Duncombe
as we drive away to Rievaulx.</p>

<p>Motorists will find it their best plan to
visit the terrace of Rievaulx before seeing
the abbey itself. The way lies through a
gate on the left at the top of an extremely
steep hill; a winding lane leads among trees
to a second gate, and here the car may
safely be left. A few steps bring us to the
famous terrace cut on the hillside by a
Duncombe of the eighteenth century. For
half a mile the wide and level turf is
stretched between the woods that overshadow
it on the left, and the woods that
fall steeply away from it on the right to
the foot of the hill. Beyond the valley
another wooded hill rises; to the south are
moors. If we stand at the brink of the
terrace and look down through a gap in
the trees we see, far below us, the pointed
arches of Rievaulx Abbey.</p>

<p>At each end of the terrace is a classical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
temple. At the north end, where we are
standing, is the one described in the local
guide-book as "a beautiful temple with an
Ionic portico." At first sight it gives one
a shock. Eighteenth-century buildings so
often do give one a shock.</p>

<p>If, however, we forget for a few minutes
that Rievaulx Abbey lies down there in the
valley, if we forget Walter of Espec and
his monks, and remember only the days
when this temple was built, the Ionic portico
has its uses. It gives us a vision of the age
of powder and hoops, of the fair ladies who
rustled here on the soft turf when George
was king. The closely cropped sward was
suited to the dainty feet, the scenery not so
"savage" as to wound the dainty susceptibilities.
Indeed, in any century, this scene
could only heal.</p>

<p class="b1">There is a path that winds down the hill
to the abbey, and if our car is independent
of us this is the best way to go. But if
she is unattended and cannot meet us in
the valley we must drive down the steep
hill to the village. The surface of this hill
is composed of ruts and loose stones, but
the beauty of the woods is compensation
for nearly anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1 b1">If Fountains Abbey speaks of power, Rievaulx
breathes peace. Taking everything
into consideration, I think its beauty has
only one rival in England. The valley of
the Rye is far lovelier than Studley Park;
the building itself is far lovelier than Bolton.
Only Tintern can rival it; not even
Tintern can eclipse it. For at Tintern
the feeling of Cistercian seclusion can only
be acquired through the imagination: a
high-road is close at hand; a brisk trade
in picture postcards and Goss china is carried
on at the abbey door; to be alone is almost
impossible. But here at Rievaulx we may
chance to stand in perfect solitude, perfect
stillness, under the mighty archway that
soars in dignified simplicity so far above
our heads, and separates us as though by
invisible gates from the world. No imagination
is needed here to conjure up the aloofness
of the white monks&mdash;the actual fact
is here. Through the empty windows&mdash;once
filled, in defiance of the early Cistercian
ideals, with some of the first efforts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
English glass-stainers&mdash;we see the wild hillside
rising from the very walls, and above
it the rampart of trees; the grass under
our feet grows like the grass of the field;
the world makes no sign, and on each side
of us the slender arches point to heaven.
There is something here that is more than
beauty; the very air seems charged with
the prayers of holy men long dead. The
weather-worn slab of the high altar is
unfortunately enclosed by a railing, which
is doubtless needed, in this Christian country,
to save it from desecration. Not near this
stone, as one might expect, but in the ruined
chapter-house, lies the dust of the monk
who came here in his old age to hide his
"broad but well-featured face" under the
shadow of a cowl, and to subdue his trumpet-like
voice to the singing of psalms&mdash;the
monk who had founded this abbey in the
days when he was a famous soldier&mdash;Walter
of Espec.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Walter founded three monasteries: one at
Kirkham, which we shall presently see; one
here; one at Wardon in Bedfordshire. Incorporated
with Leland's Itinerary is a
document which tells us how Walter's only
son fell from his horse and broke his neck
upon a stone cross, and how in consequence
Walter founded the monasteries of Kirkham
and Rievaulx with some of the wealth for
which he had now no heir. Dugdale, the
seventeenth-century antiquarian, believed the
tale, and told it for truth in his "Monasticon."
Yet now we are bidden to reject the story
of the younger Walter's sad end; nay, even
to doubt that he ever lived! He is not
mentioned, say those who know, in the
foundation-charter of the abbey; there is
nowhere in any document a statement that
Walter of Espec ever had a son. However,
till we find a definite statement that he
had none, we shall probably continue to
accept or reject the story according to
temperament.</p>

<p>There are still some fragments of the
actual church that was built by the eager
hands of the monks from Clairvaux, the
monks sent by St. Bernard himself to live
their austere lives in this valley; but, of
course, this rich triforium, these corbels of
elaborate carving, these lancets and moulded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
arches and clustered columns were never
seen by Norman Walter. Nor, indeed, would
they have met with approval from the
saintly abbot of Clairvaux, whose aspirations,
like those of all the early Cistercians,
tended to severe simplicity in architecture
as in life. The vanished nave, it is thought,
was part of the Norman work of Bernard's
missionary monks, but this glorious chancel
and the refectory with the strange doorway
belong entirely to the thirteenth century.</p>

<p class="b1">Beautiful as are the details it is by the
great chancel-arch that we shall always
remember Rievaulx. It is the reposefulness
of its simple grandeur that strikes the
keynote of peace. Its quiet, stately lines
rest the eye, and the memory of it rests
the heart whenever we think of this fair
daughter of Citeaux and mother of Melrose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Long ago there was a second Cistercian
abbey on the banks of Rye. The bells of
Old Byland and the bells of Rievaulx
clashed with one another, which for some
reason shocked the Byland monks. Those
who live in towns to-day, and Sunday by
Sunday hear the bells of seven or eight
churches ringing simultaneously in varying
keys, will sympathise with them; but there
seems to have been some idea in their
minds beyond the obvious one, an idea
strong enough to make them migrate first
to Stocking and then to the spot where
we may see the ruins of their abbey.
Those who can spare the time will find
that the beautiful west front of the second
Byland repays them well for driving the
few miles between the two ruins. The
community that finally settled on this spot
had been through a great deal. When
they came here it was more than fifty
years since the thirteen monks necessary
to found a new house had left Furness to
wander in their ox-waggon from place to
place&mdash;from Furness to Cumberland, from
Cumberland to Thirsk, from Thirsk to
Byland-on-the-Moor, from Byland-on-the-Moor
to Stocking, and from Stocking to
their final home at last. None of the
original thirteen can have seen the trefoiled
door and gigantic wheel-window of
the west front; for this, the most striking
part of the existing ruin, was probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the finishing touch to a very splendid
church.</p>

<p>Those who reach Byland may perhaps
like to drive about a mile and a half
beyond it, to see the interesting church at
Coxwold, and the house where Laurence
Sterne lived for some time and wrote the
greater part of "Tristram Shandy," alternated
with many sermons. From Coxwold a
series of byways will take them to the
high-road at Brandsby.</p>

<p>Those, however, who are unable to go
beyond Rievaulx, must return to Helmsley.
They may follow the Rye for a little
while, and then, turning to the left with
a last and lovely view of the abbey, may
mount the hill through the woods, the
fairy-haunted woods of Rievaulx, where
the stems are not wrapped about with a
confusion of undergrowth, but rise unhampered
from a carpet of ferns and
creepers. This climb among the dusky
trees is very short, but adds to one's sense
of Rievaulx's remoteness. The shadowy stillness
of these woods is like a veil dropped
between the valley and the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>After driving through Helmsley we cross
the Rye, and presently pass the upper
entrance of Duncombe Park, the "Nelson
Gate," erected as we see "to the memory
of Lord Viscount Nelson, and the unparallelled
gallant achievements of the British
Navy." Between Helmsley and Sheriff
Hutton, whither we are bound, lies some
very pretty country of a pastoral kind,
and a series of picturesque villages, several
of which deserve more attention than we
are likely to give them.</p>

<p>Here, for instance, is Oswaldkirk, which
might well tempt us to pause. It is
scattered along the side of a hill, with its
little houses half smothered in trees. The
tiny church is open, and in it are some
fragments of Saxon and Norman work,
and a Jacobean pulpit which once held the
famous John Tillotson, who began life in
a tailor's shop and ended it as Archbishop
of Canterbury. His success was chiefly due,
I believe, to his eloquence, so we may
regard this spot as the cradle of his fortunes,
since the sermon he preached here
was his first. And here in Oswaldkirk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
was born another man of mark, the antiquarian
to whom we owe so much of our
knowledge of the ruined monasteries, Roger
Dodsworth. He collaborated with Dugdale
in the "Monasticon," which was not published
till after his death. The younger man inherited
the fruit of his researches, and has
more or less eclipsed his name.</p>

<p>A little more than a mile beyond Oswaldkirk
is Gilling, one of the prettiest villages
in the county. Its wide street is bordered
by bright gardens; a tiny stream runs
through it under a row of miniature
bridges; on the left is a church with some
interesting tombs; and on the right, entirely
hidden by the trees, is the castle
of the Fairfaxes. Only those who have
secured special permission are admitted to
see this castle and its splendid Elizabethan
Hall, of which the fame has reached many
who were never in it. It is, according to
all accounts, a marvel of rich ornament,
of oaken panels and delicate inlay, of
carved mouldings and stained glass and
armorial shields.</p>

<p>A road with a perfect surface carries us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
out of the village to the top of a hill&mdash;where
one patch of heather by the wayside
reminds us that we are on Grimston
Moor&mdash;and on through Brandsby to Stillington.
The church we leave behind us as
we turn sharply to the left has no special
interest beyond the fact that Laurence
Sterne preached many of his sermons in
it, while he was living at Sutton-in-the-Forest
and at Coxwold. Here in Stillington
we leave the fine high-road for a very poor
one&mdash;one that is a mere lane in fact&mdash;which
leads us past the strange little
church of Marton-on-the-Forest, with its
crow-stepped gables and tower, to the
village of Sheriff Hutton.</p>

<p>"What is this forest call'd?" we may
be inclined to ask with Archbishop Scrope
in "Henry IV." "'Tis Gaultree Forest, an't
shall please your grace." Even in Leland's
time there was very little wood in the
neighbourhood of Sheriff Hutton, and now
the Forest of Galtres, so "impenetrable and
swampy" when the Romans set to work
to drain it, has practically vanished. A
good proportion of it, I think, must always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
have been forest only in the technical
sense, for we hear of it in the reign of
Elizabeth as the scene of a yearly horse-race,
wherein the prize for the winning
horse was a little golden bell. Moreover,
there is a tradition that wanderers in the
Forest of Galtres, which reached to the
outskirts of York, were guided by a light
hung in the lantern tower of All Saints
Church. Unless a great part of the country
were open&mdash;"low medows and morisch
ground"&mdash;this light would not have greatly
aided the belated traveller. Be that as it
may, the country is now so open that as
we draw near Sheriff Hutton we may see
with a thrill, if we look very intently
along the far horizon, the faint, elusive
gleaming of York Minster.</p>

<p>The castle of Sheriff Hutton is more
impressive at a distance than close at
hand. It is visible miles away across the
flat country, and the jagged outlines of
its cluster of towers stand up so imposingly
against the sky that one is led
to expect something rather vast and effective.
But these gaunt remnants are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
there is to see. They stand in a farmyard
and are surrounded with haystacks. Once
upon a time this castle was fine enough.
It had eight or nine great towers, "and
the stately staire up to the haul" was very
magnificent, and so was "the haul it self,
and al the residew of the house." It owed
its splendour to the splendid Nevilles, to
the great Warwick among others, who
seems always to have lived in a state of
kingly magnificence, as befitted one who
made kings. When he died it passed,
with his other castles, to his son-in-law
Richard III., who used it as a prison for
such claimants of the throne as he did
not trouble to murder. There was humour
in this plan of sending the two young
cousins to keep each other company&mdash;Edward
IV.'s daughter, Elizabeth of York,
and the youthful Warwick, son of that
Duke of Clarence who was drowned in a
butt of Malmsey. They were not here very
long, for hardly had their Uncle Richard's
ill-gotten crown fallen under the hawthorn
on Bosworth Field, before the new king's
emissary was riding in all haste to Sheriff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Hutton. There was a crowd that day
about this gate that still bears the arms
of the Nevilles and of England, for from
all the country round the people gathered
to do honour to their future queen; and
as she was led out from her prison to
share Henry's throne, the gentry of the
neighbourhood, an eager bodyguard, pressed
forward to escort her to London. Poor
cousin Warwick went to London too, with
a bodyguard of a sterner sort; for since
his claims could not, like Elizabeth's, be
merged in those of the new king, he
was destined for the Tower and the block.</p>

<p class="b1">There is no record, apparently, of how
this stately castle was transformed in the
course of one century from a "Princely
Logginges" to a mere shell. The usual
death sentence of castles, "dismantled by
order of the Parliament," was never pronounced
in this case, for the mischief
was done before Charles I. was king. In
Henry VIII.'s reign this was for a time
the home of that Duke of Norfolk who
was the uncle of two queens, and lived
to see them both upon the scaffold. He
was a witness at Anne Boleyn's wedding
and a judge at her trial, and was himself
only saved from the block by Henry's
death. His son Surrey, the sweet singer,
has walked here too, where now the hay
is stacked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Richard III. was here at least once, in
the year before his death. He and his
sad wife&mdash;sad all her life, but now heart-broken&mdash;came
here to bury their little son.
At the end of the sloping village street
is the old church where they laid him;
and there we may still see, not the place
of his burial, for that is unknown, but
the little alabaster figure that once lay
upon his tomb. It has the air of being
a good portrait. The features are still
faintly visible; the pathetic down-drawn
mouth suggests that Anne Neville's son
was not much happier than herself. Circling
the boyish head is a heavy crown,
the only crown it ever wore. The reason
that the Prince of Wales was buried here
does not appear. Some suggest that his
mother, who was with Richard at Nottingham,
could not bear to return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Middleham, and so met the funeral procession
here; but there is at least one
historian<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> who describes her despair when
she saw her dead son in his own home.
Elizabeth of York was probably at Sheriff
Hutton when her little cousin Edward
was brought here to his grave. She must
have remembered another Edward, nearer
and dearer to her, whose grave, not yet discovered,
had been so lately made at the foot
of the dark staircase in the Tower of London.</p>

<p>This ancient church has some fine brasses
in it. One of them is hidden beneath a
trap-door in the floor; another bears the
figures of two babies in swaddling clothes.
The church's patron saint is St. Helena,
the mother of Constantine, and the discoverer,
through a vision, of the Holy
Cross. The historians give us a good deal
of choice in the matter of this lady's
origin. Some declare that she was the
daughter of a British king, a woman of
surprising beauty and intelligence; but it
seems to be more likely that her father
was an innkeeper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Sheriff Hutton is only about ten miles
away from York, but if possible we should
add a few miles to the distance by making
a <i>détour</i> to Kirkham Priory. All that
there is to be seen there is comprised in
one picture, so to speak, a picture of an
old gateway and the base of a cross; but
it is a picture that one remembers.</p>

<p>To reach it we pass through country
that is sometimes moderately pretty, sometimes
dull. There is a little church at
Foston that is pleasant to the eye, with a
red-tiled roof, and a miniature bell-tower,
and a pathway where the yew-trees nearly
meet. But we are now on the borderland
between the beautiful part of Yorkshire
and the uninteresting south-eastern plain.
After we leave Kirkham we shall see little
more of the beauties of nature. We shall
see some beautiful architecture, and various
things that are more appealing to the
imagination than to the eye. And here, too,
as is so often the case where the scenery
is tame, the roads are sufficient in themselves
for the pleasure of the day's journey.</p>

<p>About a mile beyond Foston we turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
on to the high-road from Scarborough to
York; but after a few moments leave it
again for a road on the right, by which
we slowly descend into the valley of the
Derwent. The hillside is thickly wooded,
and as we pass beyond the overarching
trees we see Kirkham lying below us: the
little village, and the wooded hill beyond
it, and the beautiful gateway that is so
entirely unlike all others, and, fringed with
rushes, the wide, smooth river&mdash;the Derwent,
which we last saw at Ayton,
shadowed by the birches of the Forge
Valley and overlooked by the ruins of
Margaret Bromflete's castle.</p>

<p class="b1">This was the first of the monasteries
founded by Walter of Espec. In front of
the gateway is the base of an old cross,
of which the top step is carved with an
almost illegible design. Local tradition, in
its courageous way, declares that there is
incorporated with these steps a fragment
of the "little stone cross" that caused the
death of Walter of Espec's son. The truth
of this tale seems to depend a good deal
on whether Walter ever had a son.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">It is this gateway that we have come
to see. The fragment of wall in which it
is framed was probably built in the twelfth
century, but all this wealth of ornament
and heraldry belongs to a much later date.
The quiet valley and the stream would
suggest to one that this, like Walter's
Rievaulx, was a Cistercian house; but there
was never a Cistercian community that
would have countenanced all this display
of tracery and crockets and statuary, and
all these worldly coats of arms. They were
Augustinian Canons who made their gate
so fine, and carved upon it these ten
shields of men with sounding names&mdash;Clare
and Vaux, Scrope, Ros, Plantagenet&mdash;and
set these saints in their niches, and above
them the seal of the priory; and who
passed to their meals in the refectory
under all the varied mouldings of this
magnificent Norman door south of the
cloister-garth; and who chanted their Credo
with their eyes fixed on that lovely lancet
window, once part of the east-end of their
church.</p>

<p>And now we are at last bound for York.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
We cross the Derwent and climb the hill
again to the high-road, and there before
us, very far away, lies our goal. Faintly
shining, York Minster shows like a pale
opal hanging above the horizon.</p>

<p>The very thought of York and all that
it stands for makes the heart beat faster.
Let us open the throttle then, and speed
to it as quickly as we may; for the road
lies broad and level between the fields, and
nearly as straight as an arrow's path, and
never, if we love our engine and our
England as we should, shall we forget this
flight of ours to the city of all our kings.</p>

<p class="pn center large">YORK AND THE SOUTH</p>

<p class="pn p2">No man knows the spell of York till
he has approached it by road in the
evening. Of all the fresh experiences that
the motor-car has brought to us there
are few from which the imagination gains
so much as from this way of entering old
and beautiful towns. We have too long
accepted the roof of a railway station as
our first view of such places. It is not
an inspiring view. But to see York Minster
from afar, shining under the evening
sky and lifted high above the city; to
watch it growing larger and larger, rising
higher and higher, increasing in beauty
every moment, until at last one drives
slowly into its huge shadow; to pass
under one of the great gates that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
survived so many centuries, so many wars,
so many pageants, that have welcomed so
many kings, and dripped with the blood
of so many warriors; to see the ancient
streets for the first time idealised by the
dusk of twilight, will help us, if anything
will, to recall and realise something of
what York has been during the eighteen
hundred years of her history.</p>

<p class="b1">The past is very insistent here. Here
are the walls, encircling the whole city,
that were built by Edward I. and repaired
after the Civil War. We may drive round
them, and pass in and out of the four
gates that were once so hard to enter:
Monk Bar, by which we come in from
Kirkham under the arms of England and
France quartered together; and Bootham
Bar on the Newcastle Road; and Micklegate
Bar on the Tadcaster Road; and
Walmgate Bar, where the restored barbican
reminds us that it was undermined during
the long siege of the Civil War. All
these bars are turreted and ornamented
with painted shields and statues or helmets
of stone; three of them still have their
portcullises; three still bear the arms of
France.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">WALMGATE BAR, YORK.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1 b1">Walmgate, or Watling Gate, Bar is the
most picturesque of them on the inner
side, for it carries on its stone pillars an
Elizabethan house of timber and plaster.
But by far the richest in memories is
Micklegate Bar. Some of these memories
are of a very ghastly kind, for it was
here that the heads of "traitors" were
set up. It was here that Harry Hotspur's
head looked down upon his doubly treacherous
old father, the Duke of Northumberland,
as that time-server rode out through
the gate in perfect friendliness with
Henry IV., and found it advisable, no
doubt, to ignore the thing that stared
above the parapet. Here, in Henry V.'s
reign, the head of Lord Scrope of Masham
was set up because he favoured the House
of York; and here, half a century later,
was the head of the Duke of York himself,
crowned with paper&mdash;to be replaced, almost
before Margaret of Anjou had finished
laughing at it, by the head of the man
who put it here&mdash;Clifford the Butcher. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
hideous series closed with the followers of
Prince Charlie in the Forty-five.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">MICKLEGATE BAR, YORK.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Meantime there were other sights to be
seen at Micklegate Bar. Richard III., fresh
from one coronation and eager for another,
was received here "with great pomp and
triumph" by the citizens and the clergy
"in their richest copes," and passed through
this archway with his stolen crown upon
his head, followed by his luckless queen
and the little boy who was so soon to
die. His successor's daughter, Margaret
Tudor, entered York very gaily by this
gate with five hundred lords and ladies,
on her way to her unhappy marriage with
James IV. of Scotland. James I. was on
his way to Scotland, too, when he rode
to Micklegate Bar from Tadcaster, with
the sheriffs of York bearing their white
rods before him. He waited here while
the Mayor, kneeling in the road, presented
him with a sword and the city keys, and
a cup and a purse, "and made a worthy
speech at the delivery of each particular."
Still braver was the scene when Charles I.
came in, with that strange army that was
no army; the army that was commanded
by an "amateur general" and was intended
to overawe the Scots by pomp. "The
progress was more illustrious than the
march, and the soldiers were the least
part of the army," says Clarendon. This
sombre bar was gay enough that day. So
splendid a procession has seldom been
seen as that which filed through its dark
shadow then, all glittering and glowing,
while the trainbands of the city, magnificent
in scarlet and silver and feathered
caps, greeted Charles with a volley, and
the civic authorities on their knees greeted
him with flattery. It was not many years
before another sort of scene was enacted
on this spot: when the army of Fairfax&mdash;commanded
by no amateur&mdash;was drawn
up in a double line that stretched away
from this gate for a mile, and the two
Royalist generals who had defended the city
so finely, Glenham and Slingsby, marched
out between the two lines with the remnant
of the garrison, with all the honours
of war. That was the most stirring sight,
I expect, that Micklegate Bar has seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Fairfax and the other victorious generals
marched to the Minster and "sang a psalm."
What that psalm must have meant to
Fairfax we can hardly realise. The siege
had lasted for thirteen weeks; more than
four thousand of his men had died in the
course of it; twenty-two times they had
assaulted the walls. He was himself a
Yorkshireman, and like all Yorkshiremen,
loved and honoured the city that has held
so proud a place in English history, and the
Minster that is the city's crown. No wonder
he marched straight from the gate to the
Minster and sang a psalm! What York
Minster meant to Fairfax it must in a lesser
degree mean to every Englishman. It combines
superlative interest with superlative
beauty. We may come to it primed with
its history&mdash;the history that begins with the
Roman temple whose foundations are hidden
beneath it, the history that includes so many
great names; we may know that Paulinus
of the seventh century&mdash;the tall, majestic
man with the hawk-face whom Bede has
described for us&mdash;built the first church here
of wood, and was the first Archbishop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
York; that three other churches stood here
and were destroyed before the present
building was begun in the thirteenth century
and slowly rose to its perfection; but
when we see it we can remember nothing
but its beauty. It completely dominates
York. It is impossible to forget its presence
for a moment, whether it be dim and blurred
in the dawn or flushed with the light of
sunset.</p>

<p class="b1">Nearly every one, I suppose, has seen it.
Nearly every one has felt, on passing
through the entrance in the south transept,
that breathless sensation of awe that
is almost fear, of reverence that is almost
worship. The first sight of those immense
arches, so absolutely simple, so indescribably
majestic, with the lancets of the Five Sisters
behind them, is overwhelming. It is only
gradually that memory returns, and the
great nave slowly fills with the processions
of the past, with the weddings and funerals
and coronation pageants that have swept by,
century after century, to choir or chapter-house.
Young Edward III. and Philippa of
Hainault were a comely pair when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
were married here in the presence of the
Parliament and Council, surrounded by the
nobles of England and Scotland. Not very
many years later their little son was carried
to his grave in the north aisle of the choir.
Much was spent in alms and masses, many
pounds of wax were burnt, many widows
watched round the little coffin before
William of Hatfield was laid in this tomb
where we see his effigy, a slender, boyish
figure lying very straightly under the high
canopy. In the next century a sinister
scene took place here: Richard Crookback
mourning for his brother, coming here to
hear a requiem sung, with his head full
of plots against the dead man's little sons.
Very soon he was here again, entering
those splendid doors with the iron scrollwork,
which lead into the chapter-house
where he was crowned for the second time&mdash;the
chapter-house that Pius II. described as
"a fine lightsome chapel, with shining walls
and small, thin-waisted pillars quite round."
"As the rose is the flower of flowers," said
the monks, "so is this the house of houses."</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">There are not very many notable tombs
here, though there is much illustrious dust.
Here was buried the head of King Edwin
of Northumbria, who so "often sat alone by
himself for a long time, silent as to his
tongue, but deliberating in his heart"
whether he should become a Christian.
This Minster is in a sense the fruit of his
deliberations. There is no monument to
him, nor to Earl Tostig of the violent
temper, whose body was carried here from
Stamford Bridge; but the founder of the
present building lies in his robes under a
canopy in the south transept. We may see,
too, in the Lady Chapel, the marble tomb
of Archbishop Scrope, the builder of Bolton
Castle, who preached a sermon in this
Minster inciting the people to take up arms,
and lost his head in consequence. And near
the altar of the same chapel is a little black
kneeling figure that deserves attention. It
is a monument to Frances Matthew, the
wife of Tobie Matthew, Archbishop of York,
and the daughter of William Barlow, Bishop
of Chichester. "She had four sisters married
to four bishops.... So that a bishop was
her father, an archbishop her father-in-law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
she had four bishops her brethren, and an
archbishop her husband." Unless I am much
mistaken she had also an abbess for her
mother, which was the strangest thing of
all. There was a William Barlow, at one
time Bishop of St. David's, who is said to
have married an abbess as soon as the
Reformation made it possible, and had five
daughters married to five bishops. Frances
Matthew must surely have been one of these.
Tradition says that Bishop Barlow, who had
many unpleasant traits, stripped the lead
from the Palace of St. David's and dowered
his daughters with it; but Frances must
have been a baby, if indeed she was born,
when her father was guilty of this thievish
vandalism. She herself is described as being
above her sex, and even above the times&mdash;but
indeed all the women who were buried
in ages gone by seem to have been superior
to all the rest. She gave her husband's
library to the Minster.</p>

<p>Close to her mural monument is the
largest window in England. There is no
building, I believe, that has so much ancient
and beautiful glass as this, and it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
miracle to be thankful for that it was not
destroyed in the last century, when the
poor maniac set fire to the Minster because
he disliked the buzzing of the organ. The
soft-toned window of the Five Sisters is the
loveliest of all.</p>

<p>But all these are modern things. Down
in the crypt we shall find ourselves in touch
with the century of Paulinus and St. Chad
and St. Wilfrid, the three earliest Archbishops
of York; for here is the herringbone
work of the first stone church, and
here, they say, are the pillars of the building
that succeeded it and was destroyed by the
Danes. This is the spot on which the
Roman temple stood, and the wooden
church where King Edwin was baptized,
and the altar on which Ulphus the Saxon
laid his horn. This Ulphus was a prince in
Deira, whose sons were of a quarrelsome
temper, and were likely, he thought, to fall
out over the division of his property after
his death. So "he presently took this course
to make them equal." He carried his
favourite drinking-horn, his horn of ivory
and gold, to York, and filling it there he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
knelt before the altar of the Minster and
drank the wine in token that he endowed
the church with all his lands for ever.
That this brought peace to his family I
rather doubt; but the lands of Ulphus are
to this day in the possession of York
Minster, and the horn of Ulphus is to this
day within its walls. If we go through this
door in the south aisle of the choir we may
see it&mdash;an elephant's tusk, rich tawny in
colour, finely carved. It disappeared mysteriously
at the time of the Civil War, but
somehow fell into the hands of Fairfax,
whose son returned it to the Minster. How
it came to Fairfax is not recorded; but is
it not possible that he may have quietly
taken possession of it, knowing how unsafe
it was in the hands of the Puritans, and
have told his son to give it back in less
troubled times? Or was it perhaps one of
those relics which would have "irrecoverably
perished in the late wars" if Fairfax had
not paid "that industrious antiquary, Mr.
Dodsworth," to collect them? We know
that Fairfax had "a peculiar respect" for
antiquities, and that it was owing to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
unceasing care that the Minster suffered so
little in the war.</p>

<p>It is not in a few days that York can be
seen. Only those really know the place
who live within the enchanted walls; we
should linger here as long as possible, and
return again and again. Yet those whose
time is limited will find that even a couple
of nights spent at the justly famous Station
Hotel will enable them to see more than
the Minster without suffering from that
sense of hurry that spoils pleasure.</p>

<p>York has not hurried. In the Museum
Gardens, themselves a wonderful museum,
we may realise how many centuries she
has taken to become what she is. Here
is a tower that was raised by the Romans.
The date of it is uncertain, but Mr. Wellbeloved
tells us it was probably built when
the Conquering Legion came to Eboracum.
This, says Gibbon, was at the beginning
of the second century; so this tower of
many angles takes us back to the time
of Hadrian, to days before the Emperor
Severus died here in the palace that has
altogether vanished, bidding his sons let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
all their conduct tend to each other's
good; days long before the death of Constantius
and the accession of Constantine
the Great. It is not true that Constantine
was born in York, but it was here that
he went through his little performance of
reluctant modesty when the soldiers made
him Emperor&mdash;weeping and spurring his
horse while they pursued him with the
imperial robes.</p>

<p class="b1">In the same garden are the ruins of
St. Mary's Abbey. The Benedictine monks
who founded this community came from
Whitby, and were perhaps the builders of
the Norman apse we saw at Lastingham,
where they paused for a time on their
way to York. It is easy to see that this
remnant of a most beautiful church was
not of their raising: there is nothing
Norman here, nothing but the purest
Gothic work. It was while the earlier
eleventh-century church was still standing
that a strange scene took place here;
when the Archbishop of York with his
retinue clamoured long upon the abbey
gates in vain, while the abbot refused to
open to him; then forced his way at last
into the abbey and pronounced an interdict&mdash;here
where the grass grows under
our feet&mdash;against the abbot and his monks.
The cause of all this commotion was that
little band of brethren who built the
Abbey of Fountains with so much toil and
endurance. They were at that time monks
of St. Mary's, and had appealed to Archbishop
Thurstan to reform their house.
Abbot Geoffrey, however, preferred to remain
unreformed; and so the fiery prelate
swept off with the zealous thirteen and set
them down in the wilderness beside the
Skell to live as austerely as they would.
The Abbey of St. Mary, in spite of the
interdict, grew very great as well as
beautiful.</p>

<p class="p1">Not only at the Dissolution, but far
later, this monastery was horribly ill-treated.
Its stones have built a palace
and a prison; they have been used for
mending, and have been made into quicklime.
The palace they built has to a great
extent vanished, but the Tudor house that
stands near Bootham Bar&mdash;the red house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
with the arms of James I. over the door&mdash;is
either actually a part of it or was
rebuilt from its ruins. It was in that
house that Strafford lived when he was
President of the Council of the North;
both James I. and Charles I. stayed in it
when they came to York; and it was
probably there that Henrietta Maria lived
for three months when she brought materials
of war to the city.</p>

<p class="b1">There are other stones of St. Mary's
still to be seen, by which we may partly
guess the glory that has departed. There
are countless numbers of them in this
garden; every flower-bed is bordered with
them, and the lower part of the guesthouse,
down there across the grass, is
literally stacked with statues and mouldings
and bosses of wonderful richness.
This Hospitium is used as a museum. It
is a little bewildering, with its mingled
associations of mediæval monks and Roman
matrons. Here are all the things that we
are accustomed to see in collections of
Roman relics&mdash;pottery, tiles, jewellery,
everything from a tesselated pavement to
a circus ticket. One thing there is, however,
to which we are not accustomed; a
thing whose interest is rather painful, if
not morbid; a coil of a woman's hair, as
bright and brown as if it had been laid
in its stone coffin only yesterday. The
hair of poor Flavia or Placida would be
better buried, I think.</p>

<p class="p1">The prison that was built from the
stones of St. Mary's Abbey is on the site
of William the Conqueror's castle. It is
still called the Castle, but there is nothing
left of the fortress except one round grey
tower, standing alone on a little hill. Its
walls have been concerned with many
great deeds; much valour has defended it
and much besieged it; much English History
has been made in the shadow of it.
Yet Clifford's Tower is generally remembered
chiefly in connection with the wild
scene of horror that took place here at
the time of Richard I.'s coronation, when
the Jews of York rushed to the castle
for shelter, with their ducats and their
daughters, and were besieged by the mob.
Here, where the steps wind up between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the tidy laurels, the mad crowd yelled and
battered on the walls, while the White
Friar who led them shrieked: "Down with
the enemies of Christ!" Here within the
tower, where the grass is strewn with
exquisite fragments of Gothic ornament&mdash;probably
from St. Mary's&mdash;the starving
Jews were huddled with their families
till they grew desperate. They killed their
wives and children, and then they killed
themselves. A few surrendered, begging
for baptism, converted by these strange
methods; but they were allowed no baptism
but that of blood.</p>

<p class="b1">As we drive slowly through the streets
of York, peering now at some carved
archway, now at some time-worn coat-of-arms,
passing here under the overhanging
eaves of St. William's College, or there
under the lantern tower of St. Helen's, we
feel that the life of the past is still
existing in this city, in some strange astral
way, hidden within the life of the present.
The past is not merely a picturesque
memory here. Even if we had never
heard the magic name of York, I think
we should feel that her streets were
crowded with figures we could not see.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">A modern note is struck as we drive
out of the town past the racecourse, and
find to our pleasure that the splendid road
is "treated" with some preparation that
makes it absolutely dustless. This is the
road by which the Stewart Kings approached
York with so much show and
colour, and by which their supporters
marched away, defeated, but with honours
of war. Like them, we are going to Tadcaster.
The middle of the bridge that
spans the Wharfe at Tadcaster is the
boundary between the West Riding and
the Ainsty, or County of York City; and
this is why it was the spot where the
sheriffs welcomed the Kings of England
when they came to York. It was not on
this actual bridge, however, that Charles
was met by the citizens; for this one was
made from the ruins of the castle early
in the eighteenth century. Both castle and
bridge, it would seem, were useless by the
time they had passed from hand to hand
in the Civil War. Tadcaster was an important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
place then, an outpost of York;
even as its predecessor, Calcaria, had been
an outpost to Eboracum.</p>

<p>A couple of miles beyond Tadcaster we
pass through the village of Towton. It
was near here, in the fields that lie
between the main road and the river
Cock, that the White Rose overcame the
Red after ten hours of "deadly battle
and bloody conflict." It was on the night
before the actual battle that Lord Clifford
and his company "were attrapped or they
were ware," and Clifford, having taken off
his gorget for some reason, was killed by
an arrow "stricken into the throat."
"This end had he," says the chronicler,
"which slew the young Earl of Rutland
kneeling upon his knees." If we leave the
high-road for a few minutes, turning to
the right beyond Towton, we shall be
crossing the actual battlefield, the ground
that was such a horrible medley of snow
and blood on that Palm Sunday when
"both the hosts approached in a plain
field," the ground in which the Yorkists
stuck the spent arrows of the Lancastrians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
"which sore annoyed the legs of the
owners when the battle joined." The
falling snow, too, "somewhat blemished
and minished" their sight, and the end of
it was that King Henry's men turned and
fled towards Tadcaster. We cannot see
"the little broke called Cocke" from this
spot, but there on the right is the depression
in the fields through which it runs.
So many men were "drent and drowned"
that day in the Cock that their comrades,
it is said, crossed the stream on their dead
bodies, and even the river Wharfe was red
with blood. From this scene of slaughter,
which "did sore debilitate and much
weaken the puysance of this realme,"
Edward IV. rode into York as its master.</p>

<p>At Saxton we turn to the left and rejoin
the high-road to Pontefract, and after some
miles of good going but cheerless scenery
we cross the Aire at Ferrybridge. It was
this crossing of the Aire at Ferrybridge
that caused the death of Clifford the
Butcher on the eve of Towton; for he,
"being in lusty youth and of frank
courage," attempted to prevent Edward of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
York from passing the river, and so was
himself cut off from the Lancastrian army.
He did actually secure the bridge. Lord
Fitzwalter was keeping the passage for
Edward "with a great number of tall
personages," but Clifford and his light-horse
stole up to this spot early in the
morning "or his enemies were ware, gat
the bridge, and slew the keepers of the
same." This was the beginning of the
carnage of Towton. Lord Fitzwalter, hearing
the racket, rose from his bed and
hurried, poleaxe in hand, to join in the
fray, but "before he knew what the
matter meant" he was killed. A few
hours later Clifford, too, was dead.</p>

<p>For the last few minutes we have been
travelling on the road that holds, perhaps,
for road-lovers, more glamour in its
name than any other&mdash;the Great North
Road. We have no time to think of the
romance of it, of the millions who have
trodden its dust, of the gay-hearted vagabonds
or anxious kings who have passed
this way, for we turn from it too soon
and take the road to Pontefract.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p class="b1">I do not know if it was on this identical
road between Ferrybridge and Pontefract
that Edward IV. and Warwick rode out to
the field of Towton; it was in any case on a
very different surface. The town of Pontefract
itself is strangely unimposing for a
place of such great renown; the houses are
unpicturesque, the surrounding country dull.
Yet Camden says it is sweetly situated,
and is remarkable for producing liquorice.
There are other things for which Pontefract
has been remarkable in its day; but
as we mount the slope into the long,
straggling town there is little to show
that it has ever been concerned with
affairs of more vital importance than
liquorice. There is, it is true, a fine church
greatly ruined on our right, which has the
air of having lived through a good deal.
It was battered to pieces in the course
of three sieges, and the transept only has
been rebuilt. The strange Perpendicular
tower, of which the lower part is square
and the upper octagonal, seems oddly
enough to have suffered less than the
body of the building, for it has been very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
little restored. This church of All Saints
was connected with a religious house
whose brethren served the castle chapel;
but it was not the abbey that Camden
"industriously omits" from his description
of Pontefract, because even in his day
there was hardly a sign of it left. In his
day the walls of this forlorn nave were
still unbroken, and rising high above it
on the hill were all the towers of the
castle, a splendid cluster, with the great
Norman wall encircling them, and the
Round Tower of Ilbert de Lacy tallest of
all. Of this "high and stately, famous
and princely impregnable castle and citadel,"
as it was called only a few years before
the Civil War, there is deplorably little
for us to see. Hardly one stone was left
upon another by General Lambert. The
<i>débris</i> were heaped over the foundations,
soil was spread over all, and the sinister
fortress whose walls had echoed the sighs
of royal prisoners and the last groan of
a king, the "guilty closure" that was
drenched with blood and tears, was devoted
to the rearing of silkworms and other such
innocent uses. During the last century,
however, a good deal was excavated, and
we may without great difficulty find out
the scene of much that has happened here.</p>

<p class="p1 ppq20">"Oh, Pomfret! Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,<br />
Fatal and ominous to noble peers!"</p>

<p class="p1">The names of those to whom it has been
fatal make a long list. The most illustrious
name on that list is Richard Plantagenet.</p>

<p>That Richard was by some means done
to death in this castle is, I believe, certain;
but how he died and where is unknown.
The old tale that tells how Sir Piers
Exton and his eight men rushed into the
room where the imprisoned king was
dining, and how Richard "right valiantly
defended himself," but was finally struck
on the head with a poleaxe by Sir Piers,
who "withal ridded him of his life in an
instant," was discredited when Richard's
grave at Westminster was opened, and
the skull, which was perfectly preserved,
showed no mark of a blow. Another
theory is the one believed by Northumberland
and Harry Hotspur, who accused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Henry IV. of having traitorously caused
their sovereign lord and his "with hunger,
cold, and thirst to perish, to be murdered."
If we skirt the lawn-tennis court and turn
down a little path to the left we shall
find, behind the raised bowling-alley, a
fragment of vaulted ceiling and a wall
with three little recesses in it. This is
reputed to be Richard's prison. I do not
know if there be any real evidence that
it was so. There is certainly not the
evidence of a continuous tradition; for
until the siege destroyed it a room in
the round tower was shown to visitors as
the scene of Piers Exton's fabulous exploit
with the poleaxe&mdash;a room in which there
was a post all hacked and cut by the
blows aimed at the King! When the post
disappeared the scene of Richard's death
moved to this Gascoign Tower where we
see the vaulted ceiling. It is curious how
often the only fragment left of a building
happens to be the scene of the event in
the building's history that is most likely
to appeal to popular sentiment. One grows
suspicious of local traditions!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Richard II. was not the only prince
to be imprisoned in Pontefract Castle.
James I. of Scotland was here, and with
him were the Dukes of Orléans and
Bourbon and other prisoners taken on
the field of Agincourt. Henry V. was a
little anxious at one time lest he should
lose "the remnant of his prisoners of
France," for a plot was on foot to rescue
them. "I will," wrote the King, "that the
Duke of Orléans be kept still within the
Castle of Pomfret, without going to Robert's
Place or to any other disport; for it is
better he lack his disport than we were
deceived of all the remnant."</p>

<p>Of all those who actually met their
death here Thomas Earl of Lancaster&mdash;he
whom Gaveston called the Actor&mdash;had
the hardest fate. The place belonged to
him, and he had done much for it. Among
other things he built or repaired the tower
called Swillington, the tower that was
destined to be his own prison, whose
fragments we may see down there guarding
the moat on the north side. His
hatred of Gaveston and the Despencers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Edward II.'s favourites, brought him to
this plight; to this dark tower whose walls
he had made so thick, whose entrance was a
trap-door in the roof; to his mock trial by
his enemies in the great hall that stood here
on the north side of the lawn; to his condemnation
and ignominious death. It was
here within this court, somewhere near the
northern boundary wall, that he stood facing
the Despencers as they venomously
sent him to the block; it was here that
he uttered his last despairing words: "Shall
I die without answer?" Then they muffled
his head in an old hood and set him, the
King's uncle, on "a lean mare without a
bridle," and so led him out among the
mocking soldiers to his death. We can
see, from the castle ramparts, the hill
where he was beheaded. It is called St.
Thomas's Hill to this day, for later on he
was canonised and his grave in St. John's
Priory became a shrine. The site of the
priory&mdash;the monastery that Camden industriously
omitted&mdash;is between the hill and
the castle.</p>

<p>Pontefract was fatal to many of Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
IV.'s followers and kin. Before his final
triumph at Tewkesbury some of his
supporters were imprisoned here. "John
Pylkyngton, Mr. W. att Cliff, and Fowler ar
taken," we read in the Paston Letters, "and
in the Castyll of Pomfrett, and ar lyck to
dye hastyly, withowte they be dead." Very
hastily, too, and without trial, Edward's
brother-in-law Lord Rivers, and stepson
Sir Richard Grey died here by order of
Richard III.</p>

<p>It really seems as though there had been
something sinister in the atmosphere of this
place. Even its one gay memory&mdash;the visit
of Henry VIII. and his fifth bride&mdash;is overshadowed
by the scaffold; for it was here
that Katherine Howard put a weapon into
her husband's hand by making Francis
Derham her private secretary.</p>

<p>Indeed Pontefract has no cheerful annals:
they are all of battle, murder, and sudden
death. There was very little bloodshed, I
believe, when the leader of the Pilgrimage
of Grace took the castle; but who can
guess how many died during the three
sieges of the Civil War? The place was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Crown property, but after two sieges it
surrendered to the army of the Parliament.
It is rather difficult to ascertain by what
particular form of treachery it was recovered
by the Royalists. The deed was
done, in any case, by one Colonel Marris,
whom Clarendon describes as "a stout and
bold undertaker in attempts of the greatest
danger." Stout and bold he certainly was,
but not very attractive; for he began by
deserting the royal cause, and then, when
he wished to turn his coat again, was
enabled to carry out his plot by his close
friendship with the governor. Being always
welcome he made friends with some of the
guard. The garrison, as it happened, needed
new beds, so when Marris and some others
appeared at the gates laden with beds they
were admitted at once. They carried the
beds into that solid-looking house that was
on our right as we entered the castle, the
house that bears the arms of Lancaster over
the door. It was the Main Guardhouse.
There they flung the beds upon the floor
and overpowered the friendly guard.</p>

<p>So Pontefract came back to the Crown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the Parliamentary garrison were imprisoned
in the magazine, and the third siege began.
The magazine in which Colonel Cotterell
and his men lived for eleven weeks is
under the lawn-tennis court. If you borrow
a taper from the custodian you can go
down into it, and read, on the wall of the
staircase, the names that some of these
soldiers cut in the stone.</p>

<p>When the time came for discussing terms
of surrender General Lambert said that
Marris and five others must be given up to
him. The governor asked and was granted
six days in which the six men might do
their best to escape. On the fifth day they
had all disappeared and the garrison surrendered.
Two of the six, however, were
still within the castle, in a secret place
beneath the Pipe Tower, which stood over
there beyond the Norman Keep. They were
walled up "with great store of waste
stones," and had food for a month beside
them. The situation was a critical one.
They heard their garrison march away,
some to Newark, some to the enemy's camp,
some to their homes, the officers with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
horses and arms, even the men with Portmantles
and Snapsacks; heard the rumbling
of the three waggons that carried the
wounded; heard, during ten awful days, the
incessant clamour and crash of the first
hurried dismantling of the castle, the
clamour that might be their death at any
moment; heard at last the withdrawal of
the Parliamentary troops. Then they took
down their wall of waste stones, and stole
away.</p>

<p>These men who imprisoned themselves
were the last prisoners of Pontefract Castle,
for after this the historic ground was sown
with liquorice; but the Main Guardhouse
was spared, as we see, and for another
century or two kept up the gloomy traditions
of the place as a prison.</p>

<p>The country that lies between Pontefract
and Beverley is by no means beautiful. It
is so aggressively dull that it may almost
be called ugly. It is not for the sake of
the scenery, truly, that we cover so many
miles of Southern Yorkshire, but chiefly for
the sake of Beverley Minster; and there are

of their tour. Those who do not care for
historical memories unless there be something
beautiful connected with them I
advise to drive across from York to
Beverley by the most direct road.</p>

<p>Half-way between Pontefract and Knottingley
we have once more a flashing
glimpse of the Great North Road and the
immense signposts that mark its dignity,
and are in themselves a lesson in geography;
at Chapel Haddlesey we cross a
toll-bridge. These are the only incidents
on this singularly uneventful route until
we reach Selby; but as all good motorists
very well know, the road without incidents
is often as happy as the country without
history, and the particular road that lies
through these melancholy fields and unattractive
villages is very fine. Those who
depend on horses or trains cannot vary their
speed according to the beauty of the
country, but to us is given the special joy
of sauntering through lovely landscapes and
hurrying on when there is nothing to be
seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1906 the name of Selby was brought
into tragic prominence by the fire that
made its abbey roofless and "only not a
wreck." But as there are disastrous
victories so there are beneficent calamities;
and Selby Abbey, it seems, whose restoration
has already been a triumph of energy,
will soon be more complete than it has
been since 1690, when the tower fell and
ruined the south transept.</p>

<p class="b1">This grand church is the work of many
hands. It is a mixture of every style of
architecture, both within and without:
Early Norman, Transition, Early English,
Decorated, Perpendicular. The west front,
for instance, has a splendid Norman doorway
with five mouldings, and above it an
Early English window filled with Perpendicular
tracery. No part of this building was
raised by the founder; and indeed it was
not to this exact spot, but nearer to the
Ouse, that Benedict of Auxerre, bringing
with him "the glorious finger" of St.
Germanus and the memory of a heavenly
vision, came to set up his hut. The first
benefactor of the foundation was the man
who presented a tent to shelter the relic,
round which a cluster of wooden buildings
grew, and formed the first monastery of
Selby. William the Conqueror gave land,
and a charter, and many privileges; and
Abbot Benedict won from the Pope
the much-coveted honour of the mitre.
William's charter was dated the year after
the birth of Prince Henry, and its great
generosity, it is said, was prompted by the
fact that Selby was the birthplace of this
favourite son of the king, Henry the fine
scholar, Henry the lion of justice. To him,
says an old chronicler, "Almighty God gave
three gifts&mdash;wisdom, victory, and riches."
Yet his wisdom failed him, alas, in the
matter of lampreys!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">It was Abbot Hugh, a member of that
great house of de Lacy which gave so many
fine buildings to England, who raised the
abbey on the spot where it still stands.
That massive pillar at the east end of the
nave, the pillar with the spiral mouldings,
was part of his work. It is even possible
that some of its stones were actually laid
in their places by his strenuous hands, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
he worked with the builders. It is a fine
picture&mdash;the beautiful pillar rising course by
course towards the open sky, as Hugh de
Lacy, abbot and noble, with infinite care
and reverence fixed each stone in its place
with a hymn of praise.</p>

<p>The later abbots, the three who in the
fourteenth century raised the choir that has
been called peerless, were men of another
fashion&mdash;not especially humble&mdash;members of
Parliament, entertainers of kings, men of
the world. Yet to them, too, we owe much
gratitude for all this splendour of ornament,
these capitals and bosses, this great east
window, this flowing parapet that is so
often repeated. And, as a nation, we owe
gratitude to all those whose work or money
has helped in the recent restoration.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>There is nothing but the abbey itself to
keep us in Selby. There is no sign by
which we may know the spot where Sir
Thomas Fairfax, by defeating the Royalists
and capturing their colonel, first made his
name honoured. We do know, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
that he and his troops marched to Selby
on that occasion by this wondrously level
road upon which we drive away. For the
first mile or so, until we turn away from
the Ouse, we are on the road that used
to be, in the old coaching days, called the
lower road to York. It diverges from the
Great North Road at Barnet, and though
not the main highway, was the more direct
route, and therefore the one chosen by
those who were in a hurry. It is for a
very short time that we are on it; but
surely, for a moment, above the humming of
the engine, above the rushing of the wind,
we hear the ringing of Black Bess's hoofs.</p>

<p>Five level miles bring us to the door of
Hemingborough Church, which is large and
renowned, but of a dreariness so gaunt
and bare that it altogether fails to charm.
Its walls, unsoftened by creepers, rise from
the treeless landscape in uncompromising
severity; and inside the building the colourless
effect is equally depressing, in spite of
some fine woodwork. The tall and slender
spire is really beautiful, however, and may
be seen for miles across the plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>To visit Wressle Castle we must leave
the direct road to Howden, turning to the
left immediately after crossing the Derwent.
Here again the sad landscape seems to
have infected the building. Theoretically it
has all the elements of romance, and to
read of it without seeing it is to conjure
up a picture of decaying splendour, of
venerable walls eloquent of revelry and
war, a picture worthy of the great names
of Percy and Lacy and Seymour. A castle
founded by that Earl of Worcester whose
headless body lies in Shrewsbury Abbey
because he fought for Richard II.'s lost
cause, a castle that has seen all the might
of the Northumberlands and all the tragedy
of civil war, must surely have "the grand
air." So one thinks till one has seen
Wressle. In the background is a building,
shabby but not ruined; in the foreground
is a cabbage-patch.</p>

<p>Yet once this place was all magnificence,
made "al of very fair and greate squarid
stone both withyn and withoute." Leland
tells us of its halls and great chambers,
and its five towers, and its brewhouse without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the wall, and its "botery, pantery,
pastery, lardery, and kechyn." All these
things were exceedingly fair, he says, and so
were the gardens within the moat and the
orchards without. It was here where the
cabbages are that those fair gardens grew.
And in the orchards were mounds, "writhen
about with degrees like turninges of cokilshilles,
to cum to the top without payn."
Most fondly of all he describes the "study
caullid Paradise," with the ingenious device
of ledged desks for holding books. There,
looking down upon us from the upper part
of the tower nearest to the road, are the
empty windows of that Paradise whose inhabitants
were driven out of it for ever
by the flaming sword of Civil War.</p>

<p>This is only a fragment of the original
castle. The Northumberlands needed a considerable
amount of house-room, for they
had, it appears, two hundred and twenty-nine
servants. There were gentlemen to wait
before noon and gentlemen to wait after
noon, and gentlemen to wait after supper;
there were yeoman officers, and groom
officers, and grooms of the chambers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
there was a groom for brushing clothes,
a groom of the stirrup, a groom to dress
the hobbies and nags, a groom to keep
the hounds, a groom to keep the gates,
and an endless list of others. The day
came when the servants in this house were
called upon by the Parliament to demolish
it themselves, and were given a month to
do it in. This one side of the quadrangle
was all they left. It is possible, I believe,
to climb one of the towers to see the view&mdash;but
I cannot think it desirable. The view
from the bottom of the tower is not so
attractive as to make one wish for more.</p>

<p>A very great relief to the eye is Howden,
about three miles further on. The town
itself is not without a certain degree of
picturesqueness, though it was scarcely a
happy thought to surmount the ancient
steps of the cross in the market-place by
a modern street lamp. However, from that
same market-place we see, behind the red
houses, the ruined gable-end of the church
that is Howden's pride, whose lovely tower
is one of the landmarks of the plain. The
peculiarly slender and graceful effect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
this tower is partly owing, I think, to the
unusual height of the lower stage compared
with the upper. Those tall lancets were the
work of Walter Skirlaw, Bishop of Durham,
whose palace stood over there to the east of
the church, where the pretty gardens are.
If we venture a little way on foot along
that lane at the corner of the square, we
may see, without trespassing, the beautiful
old ivy-covered wall and the blocked gatehouse
with the shield upon it, within which
the bishops of Durham were wont to seek
rest and change. Camden's tale, to the effect
that Bishop Skirlaw built "the huge tall
steeple" as a refuge for the inhabitants in
times of flood, need not be believed; it was
probably the invention, as a certain quaint
old book suggests, of "some doating scribe,
desirous of assimilating the steeple of
Howden Church to the tower of Babel."</p>

<p class="b1">In the thirteenth century the Archbishop
of York, seeing that this church was "very
wide and large," and rich enough to support
"many spiritual men," made it collegiate.
Hence arose the need for the chapter-house
that Walter Skirlaw built on the south side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of the choir, and made so wonderfully
beautiful that even now, robbed as it is of
its groined roof and much of its rich ornament,
it dwells in one's mind as a thing apart.
The Decorated choir, which was first the
work and afterwards the shrine of the
thirteenth-century poet, John Hoveden, is
itself a ruin; for when the church lost its
prebends and its riches in the reign of
Edward VI. there was neither need nor
means left for keeping this part of the
building in repair. The nave is still the
parish church.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">After leaving Howden we have to pass,
with what speed we may, over ten more
miles of absolutely level, absolutely uninspiring
country. Then we go through North
Cave, where George Washington's ancestors
used to live; and at last the road begins to
rise over Kettlethorpe Hill. The flat land
is laid out like a map below us; far
away upon the horizon&mdash;which is level as
the sea&mdash;rises "the huge tall steeple" of
Howden; and between the plain of Yorkshire
and the rising-ground of Lincolnshire
are the sullen waters of that great river
that has brought England so much of
her prosperity. Not always, however, has
the Humber brought prosperity. More
than a thousand years ago the fleet of
the avenging Danes, Hinguar and Hubba,
swept up between these low banks, to lay
this rich country waste. Right into the heart
of the land they sailed, and ceased not to
destroy till all the country of the fens was
desolate. Now this calamity and much more
besides&mdash;the destruction of Lindisfarne and
Whitby, of Croyland and Ely and Peterborough,
and the death of St. Edmund the
King&mdash;was brought about by the jealousy of
one obscure individual. For Lothbroc the
Dane, being a guest at Edmund's Court, had
showed so much skill in the trapping of birds
and beasts that the King's head-keeper, as
one may call him, was "inflamed with mortal
envy." So he slew Lothbroc treacherously.
Then the King sent the murderer to sea in a
little boat, without sail or oars, and the boat
drifted to the shores of Denmark. And the
wicked keeper sought the sons of Lothbroc,
whose names were Hinguar and Hubba, and
told them that their father had been slain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
by order of King Edmund. So Hinguar
and Hubba swore by "their almighty gods
that they would not leave that murder
unpunished"; and verily they fulfilled
their oath.</p>

<p>Two hundred years later another Dane,
Sweyn of the Forked Beard, "a cruel man,
and ready for the shedding of blood," sailed
up to conquer the north. Just beyond that
island that lies close to the left bank, where
we see the Ouse suddenly widen into the
Humber, Sweyn turned into the river Trent.
And "all England groaned like a bed of reeds
shaken by the west wind."</p>

<p>At the top of the hill we pass through a
wonderful avenue of beeches and sycamores;
then run down a long and pleasant slope into
Walkington; and soon the blue towers of
Beverley appear.</p>

<p>The brief run across the common above
Beverley will probably be the last of our
memorable moments in Yorkshire: the last
of those memories which we motorists&mdash;while
the days are long and the winds are soft and
the engine purrs contentedly hour after hour&mdash;hoard
up to enjoy again and again, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
only through the winter but through the
years. This particular moment is a very short
one; but it will be long, I think, before we
forget the beauty of the town of Beverley as
it lies in the blue dusk of a summer evening,
with its matchless towers dominating it.</p>

<p>Yes, surely, they are matchless! See how
the straight, clean lines of their tall buttresses&mdash;those
parallel lines that are repeated again
and again in the Perpendicular panels, and
even in the deep shadows cast by the
masonry&mdash;give the impression of slenderness
and height. Not anywhere, not at Lincoln,
not at York, are there towers of a design
so complete and finished, of a simplicity so
exquisite. Nowhere else does the accumulation
of straight lines produce so rich a
whole; nowhere else are the very shadows
used to enhance the effect. There is much
that is beautiful in Beverley Minster, but in
the main it is these twin towers that are
going to be our compensation for all those
miles we have driven between flat fields,
"enclosid," as Leland says, "with hegges."</p>

<p class="b1">The monastery of Beverley was founded,
or at all events much frequented in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
eighth century, by a certain Archbishop of
York, who retired hither "out of a pious
aversion to this world," and has been known
ever since as St. John of Beverley. Bede's
account of this saint is well worth reading.
He was a man of many miracles, of much
kindliness, of some sharpness of tongue.
Never was there a saint of so much commonsense,
mingled with the compelling power
that works miracles in every age. There
was a "dumb boy," for instance, who had
also a sore head. The archbishop divined the
nervous nature of the dumbness, and cured
it so thoroughly that the youth talked incessantly
for a day and a night, as long as
he could keep awake. Then the archbishop
"ordered the physician to take in hand the
cure of his head." The shrewd saint recognised
his own limitations. On another
occasion he was brought to heal a dying
nun. "What can I do to the girl," he
asked tartly, "if she is like to die?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1 b1">Such was St. John of Beverley, of whom
we may see a picture, though not, I fear,
a portrait, in the south transept of this
minster. It represents him receiving from
King Athelstane a charter with a portentous
seal and the following legend:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq30">"Als fre make I the<br />
as hert may thynke<br />
or egh may see."</p>

<p class="p1">King Athelstane, it is true, was by no
means a contemporary of St. John of
Beverley, but he regarded the saint as his
special benefactor, and gave many privileges
to Beverley on that account&mdash;so the symbolism
is pretty even if the picture is not. If we
walk along the nave till we are beneath
the second boss of the vaulted roof, counting
from the east, we shall be above the spot
where John of Beverley's dust has lain for
many centuries. He was originally buried in
the porch; probably his bones were moved
when the Saxon Church was replaced by a
Norman one. I do not know on what
authority the local guide informs us that
Athelstane's dagger is in this grave. Gibson,
who in his additions to Camden describes
the opening of the tomb in the seventeenth
century, makes mention of no dagger, but
only of the sweet-smelling dust, and the six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
cornelian beads, and the brass pins and iron
nails. Athelstane, it is true, left his dagger
as a hostage on St. John's grave while he was
fighting the Scots; but the story says that
he redeemed it on his return by re-founding
the monastery as a college, and granting
it the right of sanctuary. Hence the legend
on the charter.</p>

<p>In the north aisle of the choir, near the
entrance to the Percy Chapel, is the visible
symbol of that right of sanctuary, the Fridstool,
the plain rounded seat in which he
that sat was safe even though he were
a murderer, the sacred centre of the six
circles that conferred each its own amount
of security. To this Stool of Peace, in the
days when it stood beside the altar, many
a man&mdash;indeed many a ruffian&mdash;has owed
his life and the freedom he so little
deserved. It was to this very seat that
Richard II.'s half-brother, Sir John Holland,
came hurrying through the night. Froissart
tells the story, how Holland and Lord
Ralph Stafford met in a lane but could
not see each other for the darkness. "I
am Stafford," said one. "And I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Holland," said the other, and added: "Thy
servants have murdered my squire whom
I loved so much." Then he killed Lord
Ralph with a blow. Stafford's servant
cried out that his master was dead. "Be
it so," said Sir John; "I had rather have
put him to death than one of less rank,
for I have the better revenged the loss of
my squire." In spite of this haughty attitude,
however, he lost no time in taking
refuge here. The beautiful towers were
not in existence then, but the nave through
which he hastened was this Decorated
nave that we see now, and these Early
English arches were above him as he sat
in the sanctuary, and close to him was that
wonderful canopied tomb near the altar,
supposed to be the grave of Eleanor, Lady
Percy.</p>

<p>If it were not eclipsed by the minster
the church of St. Mary at Beverley would
be more famous than it is, for it, too, is full
of beauty and interest. But only those
who are very enthusiastic lovers of architecture,
or who are able to spend some
days in the town, will risk confusing their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
memories of the first with the details of
the second.</p>

<p>Beverley, though never fortified, had once
three gates. Of these only one still stands,
the North Bar. Beneath its crow-stepped
parapet Charles I. must have passed with
an angry heart when he rode out to York
after his futile expedition to Hull. And it
is very likely that we, if we are going
south, shall drive out of Beverley upon the
same road by which he came from Hull the
night before, with the first open defiance
of one of his own towns ringing ominously
in his ears.</p>

<p>Who thinks of history when he goes to
Hull? It is, no doubt, like all great commercial
centres, of paramount interest to
its inhabitants; but to the traveller what
is it? A starting-place, a place where there
are docks, railway stations, hotels. Even
that increasing band of travellers who are
learning, with the help of bicycles and
motor-cars, to know their country with the
intimate knowledge that nearly always
means love, to linger in its historic towns,
to seek its little villages, and to eat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
familiar bacon-and-eggs of its wayside inns,
even these are fain to pass through Hull
with no thought beyond their anxiety to
reach some other place. Beyond the two
old churches of Holy Trinity and St. Mary
there is nothing here to see except a good
deal of prosperity and the squalor that
prosperity brings.</p>

<p>Yet even these wide streets of central
Hull, with all their prosaic traffic, should
take our thoughts back to Edward I. These
things are the justification of that astute
and high-handed king; they are the fulfilment
of his prophecy. This sheltered
corner of the Humber, he thought, would
make a fine position for a commercial
town. To think of a thing was to do it at
once, with our first Edward; so he bought
the land from the Abbey of Meaux, made
himself a manor, called the place King's
Town, built some houses, and paid people
to live in them. Well, there may be some
even now who would have to be paid to
live in Hull; but none the less Edward
was wise here as in most other places.</p>

<p>And, moreover, as we reach the outskirts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of this town we may recall that one of
the most dramatic scenes in English history
was enacted here&mdash;that defiance of
Charles I. at the walls of his own town,
which was the gauntlet flung by the
Parliament.</p>

<p>War was yet not declared, but there was
great store of ammunition in Hull which
might, thought Charles, be useful by and
by. So he, with two or three hundred
others, set out from York to see about the
matter, and as he drew near this town&mdash;fortified
then with a great wall and many
towers&mdash;he sent a message to bid the
governor dine with him. I do not know if
there is any vestige left of the wall to
which Charles presently came, or any
record of the spot where he paused, dumbfounded,
before the gate. This, he surely
thought, as he scanned the walls and the
closely shut gates and the hostile draw-bridges,
this was a strange welcome to his
city of Hull, the King's Town! Here were
no sheriffs marching out to meet him as
at York, nor gay trainbands, nor kneeling
mayors; but walls manned with soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
who were anything but gay, and inhospitable
gate-keepers whom he could by no
means persuade to let him pass, and on the
ramparts the unhappy governor, Sir John
Hotham. "And when the King commanded
him to cause the port to be opened," says
Clarendon, "he answered like a distracted
man that no man could understand; he fell
upon his knees, used all the execrations
imaginable, that the earth would open and
swallow him up if he were not his
Majesty's most faithful subject." Yet in
spite of all his protestations this man "of
a fearful nature and perplexed understanding"
was quite clear in his mind as to
what his intentions were, and not too fearful
to carry them out. The King should
not come in.</p>

<p>Then solemnly, from below the wall they
might not enter, the King's officers made
proclamation that Sir John Hotham,
Governor of Hull, was a traitor; and
Charles, with his head high but his spirits
very low, rode on to Beverley in the
shadow of the Great Rebellion.</p>

<p>Our plight at this moment is not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
same as his. If his difficulty was to enter
Hull, ours lies in the leaving of it&mdash;supposing,
that is to say, that we wish to
cross the Humber by the ferry. There are
no arrangements of any kind for shipping
cars. A narrow, precipitous gangway, with
a right-angled turn in the middle, is the
only means of passing from the quay to
the ferry-boat. The transit is a matter of
difficulty for any car&mdash;for a large one it is
impossible. Hull, however, is a progressive
place, as befits the town of that most progressive
king who saw its possibilities so
long ago. Very soon, we cannot doubt, the
shipping of a car on the shores of the
Humber will be less like a feat in a circus
than it is at present.</p>
